Whether, in considering whether disclosure of the documents in question would involve the unreasonable disclosure of personal information, the Tribunal was required to have regard to the public interest in applicants to the RRT being enabled to test whether they had been accorded procedural fairness when not given an opportunity to deal with material presented to the RRT. I reject these submissions. The Tribunal erred in finding that section 41(1) of the Act was of application without a finding that the documents in question contained information about the third party, and not simply "personal" to that party.
