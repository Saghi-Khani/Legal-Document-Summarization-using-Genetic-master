Mr Theo's appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal was unsuccessful, as were his previous applications for internal review. 6 The basis for those orders is that Mr Solon Theo applied for a Disability Support Pension on 23 May 2006. At that time he was 72 years of age. 1 This is a notice of motion filed on 25 January 2007 which, amongst other things, seeks that the notice of appeal lodged by Mr Theo in these proceedings, QUD 465 of 2006 be dismissed under O 53, r 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules .
