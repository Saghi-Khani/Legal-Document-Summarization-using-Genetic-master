In the course of the adjourned hearing on 6 March 2009 Mr Allardyce produced for inspection an embodiment of the alleged invention of the patent application. Pacific Technologies was directed to file submissions in support of its position by 21 October 2008. By the proceeding, Victoria claims a declaration that the Help Words do not constitute an original literary work in which copyright subsists pursuant to s 32 of the Copyright Act . The provisional specification related to a driver duress alarm. Victoria says that the Help Words constitute an idea and therefore are not protectable as a work.
