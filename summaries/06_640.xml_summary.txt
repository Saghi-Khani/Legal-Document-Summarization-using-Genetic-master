'  Those Insuring Clauses' would tend to indicate that the subject policies are in the nature of claims made policies. However the Insurers drew attention to the circumstance that there had been no evidence tendered as to Mr Teves' role or association with ARMA at the time of commencement of the first policy. 32 PCL advanced an alternative claim for indemnity based on the first policy, that being of course issued by Macquarie to ARMA for the period of cover 26 July 2003 to 26 July 2004. We have been instructed to take action to recover any shortfall from you.
