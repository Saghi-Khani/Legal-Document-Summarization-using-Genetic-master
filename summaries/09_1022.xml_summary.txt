I accept the ACCC's submission that the change in the wording does not materially alter the application of s 47(6) of the TPA because a merchant could only enter both Bill Express Contracts and by reason of cl 14(i) or (j) and the definition of "Agreement" in the Merchant Contract, each merchant was still bound by both Bill Express Contracts. The Bill Express Payment System operated from 2003 until about July 2008. The section looks to the supply of services upon that condition. It is majority owned by Equip Rentals Pty Ltd. 12) Ltd . I agree.
