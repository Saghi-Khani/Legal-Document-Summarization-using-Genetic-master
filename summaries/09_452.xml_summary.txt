2 claimed against Sunstate Orchards and Mr Strahley (the respondents in the proceeding) damages for the contended losses suffered in reliance upon the representations. Mr Tracy must then fund Citrus's costs of that action to trial and judgment and satisfy any security for costs orders likely to be made against Citrus. It has not been paid since 9 January 2009. The administrator sought time to talk to Mr Tracy "to see how good the Deed of Company Arrangement is". The application was returnable on 17 April 2009. If the appeal is unsuccessful, no creditor will receive anything.
