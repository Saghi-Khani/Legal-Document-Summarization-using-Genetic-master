The affidavit of Mr Oldfield establishes that the reason for the application for the amendment at this stage is that the solicitors for the respondents issued a subpoena on 14 May 2009 to FirstMac Limited. The amended defence proposes amendments which fall in two classes. They have no alternative in order to claim proportionate liability other than to plead the amended defence which they have done on the basis of the evidence currently in existence. Accordingly, the importance of the amendment in this case cannot be overlooked. Apparently, the documents were produced in a not particularly helpful way.
