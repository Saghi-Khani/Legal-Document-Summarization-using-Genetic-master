These are the cases upon which I relied in my reasons for decision. 9 Accordingly, I will order that Mr Gryst pay Dromana its costs on a party and party basis up to and including 16 July 2008 and thereafter on a solicitor and client basis. Before the matter was referred by Registrar Christie to me for it to be heard and determined, she indicated to Mr Gryst's then counsel that Tixana was not the only relevant case and that if she was hearing the matter she would as of course follow Tixana .
