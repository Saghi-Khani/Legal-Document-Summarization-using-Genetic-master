On 24 September 2004 the Federal Magistrates Court made a sequestration order against Mr Garrett's estate. In that settlement deed, Mildara Blass Limited agreed to pay the trustees, who were then Mr Garrett and his wife, Mrs Averil Garrett of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust, the sum of $1.8 million. The parties presently before me are also parties in action SAD 29 of 2005. Evajade Pty Ltd is the second respondent in these proceedings. 14 Mr Garrett therefore seeks to be joined in these proceedings as the trustee of the Andrew Garrett Family Trust No 3.
