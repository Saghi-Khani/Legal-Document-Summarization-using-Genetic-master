Relevantly, s 101(2) to (4) provide:   (2) Subject to subsection (3) and to section 102, if, at the end of the proceedings relating to an opposed application, the court is satisfied that the grounds on which the application was made have been established, the court may order the Registrar to remove the trade mark from the Register in respect of any or all of the goods and/or services to which the application relates. None of that evidence was before the delegate. The evidence establishes use during the relevant period of the trade mark on footwear.
