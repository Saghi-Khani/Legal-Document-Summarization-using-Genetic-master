1 On 22 June 2007 in respect of both QUD324/2005 and QUD522/2005 I ordered as follows:   1. The respondent pay to the applicant damages by way of compensation in the sum of $40,000 for the loss and damage caused by the said unlawful contravention of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 ("DD Act"). The courts have ordered apologies to be made in appropriate circumstances. The evidence does not support a finding that the applicant was "publicly humiliated", particularly in relation to events at Smithfield Community Health Centre. The respondent pay interest on such damages.
