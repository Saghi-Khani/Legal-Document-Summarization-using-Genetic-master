I propose to order, therefore, that in relation to the hearings after the hearing of 11 July 2007, the plaintiffs' costs be taxed on an indemnity basis and reimbursed in accordance with s 466(2) of the Corporations Act . 2 Pursuant to these orders I have received written submissions from the plaintiffs, T & G Welding Pty Ltd ('T & G Welding') (a supporting creditor), ASIC, and Saxbys. 24 ASIC also seeks costs of its notice of motion dated 28 September 2007 notwithstanding that it was dismissed on 5 October 2007. 22 However, in this proceeding, ASIC appropriately played a significant part.
