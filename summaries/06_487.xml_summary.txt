Consequently, subject to one matter, I see no principled basis for reducing the general costs order below 100%. Counsel for the respondents argue that any general costs order should exclude all costs associated with the report or evidence of Stuart Robertson of Ernst and Young, Chartered Accountants. 7 In my earlier reasons for judgment, I stated why I declined to accept Mr Robertson's estimate of damages. However, the need for evidence, upon which such assistance might fasten, is even more plain. 2 The applicants seek a general order for costs of the proceeding. 6 There is a subsidiary issue.
