The question that arises on the appeal is whether on 17 October 2007, Mr Pomare was notified of the cancellation decision "in accordance with subsection 501G(1)" (see s 500(6B) of the Act). The notice must, in addition, state "where" the application to the Tribunal for review can be made. 9 Mr Pomare was "in the migration zone" at all relevant times. 30 Counsel for the Minister submits, correctly, that the facts of the present case are different from those in Zhan because the written notice in the present case did state "the Tribunal at GPO Box 9955".
