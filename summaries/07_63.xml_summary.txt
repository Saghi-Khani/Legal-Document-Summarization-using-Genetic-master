Notwithstanding that the Tribunal has in its decision record reflected an analysis of the claims made by the Appellant, the erroneous references to Indonesian nationality and the notion of a well-founded fear of persecution should the Appellant return to the Peoples Republic of China can only lead to the conclusion that the errors have affected the exercise of the power. On 16 November 2005, the Appellant sought review of that decision before the Tribunal. If it falls within the decision-maker's lawful authority then the error is made "within jurisdiction".
