As Cadbury correctly acknowledges, even if the ACCC has no privilege claim over the Category II and Category III documents, Visy may nevertheless be prevented from producing the documents by virtue of its implied undertaking to use the statements only for a purpose relating to the ACCC proceeding. Amcor witness statements drafted by Amcor's external solicitors  39 I now turn to consider the first question. As one would expect, Cadbury relies on these cases. It follows that advice privilege cannot attach to communications between the witnesses and investigators. As such, these three documents were also privileged.
