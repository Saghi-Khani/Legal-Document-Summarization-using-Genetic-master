7 The principles applicable to granting leave to appeal from interlocutory orders are reasonably well settled. The Federal Court of Australia has no jurisdiction to hear the Application for an Order of Review filed by the applicant on 24 August 2006 against the first, second and third respondents. 5 After I delivered judgment this morning, the applicant, who was self-represented in Court, orally applied for leave to appeal against my decision to the Full Court of the Federal Court. ORDER   1. The applicant is granted leave to appeal against orders made in QUD 325/2006 on 10 November 2006.
