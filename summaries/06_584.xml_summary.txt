Compelling and compassionate circumstances   102 Once the Tribunal had found that Ms Antipova and Mr Petrou had not been in a marriage-like relationship for 12 months before Ms Antipova applied for her visa, it was necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether reg 1.15A(2A)(b) of the Migration Regulations applied. 79 In my view, the Tribunal did not give Ms Antipova a fair hearing in these two respects. The issues include denial of procedural fairness. There is also a question whether the Tribunal misconstrued a criterion applicable to Ms Antipova's case.
