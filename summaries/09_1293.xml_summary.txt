Email from SN of SD dated 12 March 2003 (sent 9:29 am) MR of CG, cc/-MC (as agent for the Applicants) Accountant's Advice Advice privilege 37. Provided that the dominant purpose requirement is met I see no reason why privilege should not extend to the communication by the expert to the client . File note by SN of SD dated 13 March 2003  File Note Advice privilege 44. File note by SN of SD dated 11 October 2002  File Note Advice privilege 18. Which brings me to the SD documents which are under challenge.
