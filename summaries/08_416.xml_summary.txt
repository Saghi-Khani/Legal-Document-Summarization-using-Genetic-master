The reasonable steps would have included the following action: • Requiring that Pan's quality assurance manager provide Mr Selim with written monthly reports detailing various matters. The Liquidators say that that opinion is based on studies conducted by Mr Williams in relation to staffing loads and on his experience. • Pan did not implement reasonable procedures for the regular audit of its compliance with GMP. At no stage does the Clark report identify the criteria of practicability. • Revise existing new product introduction procedures to include risk based process validation programs.
