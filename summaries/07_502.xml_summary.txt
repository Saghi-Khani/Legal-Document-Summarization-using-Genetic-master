Particulars (vii) and (viii) claim that the Tribunal failed to ensure that the applicant understood the relevance of the above mentioned country information during its hearing, which led to him not having a chance to comment on that information. I say that there are procedural errors in Tribunal's decision constituting an absence of natural justice. On 31 March 2005 the appellant applied to this Court for judicial review of the decision of the RRT. The respondents have not considered the evidence which is in favour of me. This complaint does not identify a jurisdictional error.
