Ground 24 The contention in this ground of appeal is that the Tribunal erred in law in failing to find that the clinical onset of the applicant's anxiety disorder was 20 August 1973. Factor 5(a) referred to "being obese" at the time of the clinical onset of hypertension. The Deputy President said that he was not satisfied that the applicant had been infected with the bacteria, helicobacter pylori, during his Army service. This ground of appeal does not raise a question of law. Oliver and Deledio do not support the applicant's submission for reasons previously given.
