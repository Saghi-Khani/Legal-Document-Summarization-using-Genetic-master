As the Court said in SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 739 at [12] :  [Section 424AA] places no obligation on the Tribunal but enables it, if it so chooses, to orally give to an applicant any information which the Tribunal considers would be part of the reason for affirming the decision under review. It also alerted the appellant to the Tribunal's belief that the appellant could obtain protection from threats if he returned to Gujarat. The Federal Magistrate dismissed this ground. The applicant stated that he reported to the police that unknown people attacked him.
