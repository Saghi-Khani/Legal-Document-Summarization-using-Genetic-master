8 Section 422(1) of the Workplace Relations Act provides that:   "An appeal lies to the Court from a judgment of a court of a State or Territory in a matter arising under this Act. By the Training Bond, Mr Clarke agreed to pay $7,500 to REX if he left REX's employment within a specified time. At any time during the probationary period the giving of two week's notice may terminate this contract. REX was a party to the Certified Agreement. I will return to consider the provisions of the Certified Agreement later in these reasons.
