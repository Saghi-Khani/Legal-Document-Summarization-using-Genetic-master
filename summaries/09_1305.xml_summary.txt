Unilever sought declarations that Goodman Fielder had breached the Act, injunctions to restrain similar future conduct and damages. This case concerns the means used, not the outcome sought. Logicol was represented by the new logo as recommended No 1. The inclusion of plant sterols in table spreads is effective in inhibiting cholesterol absorption and thus in lowering levels of LDL cholesterol. According to the evidence, the new Logicol containers were displayed in supermarkets in close proximity to other table spreads, including Pro-Activ. Issues concerning any claim for damages are not dealt with in the present judgment.
