On 16 October 2009, Mr Smith commenced the present proceeding seeking an order that AFAL be wound up pursuant to s 62ZJ(1)(b) of the Act or, in the alternative, pursuant to s 461 of the Corporations Act . Section 62K of the Act provides, relevantly, that APRA may apply to the Federal Court for an order that a general insurer be placed under judicial management. These are the reasons why I made those orders. In his report as judicial manager, Mr Smith considers the various courses of action provided for in s 62ZI(2) of the Act.
