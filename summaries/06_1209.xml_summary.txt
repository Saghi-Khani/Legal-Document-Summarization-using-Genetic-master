The consequence is that the order dismissing that application made on 14 October 2005 stands, as does the decision of the Tribunal. They indicate why the matters raised by Mr Ting did not demonstrate jurisdictional error. 10 Mr Ting was given notice under s 119 of the Act that the Minister was considering cancelling his student visa for possible breach of condition 8202. 14 The Migration Review Tribunal rejected the first claim. The relevant condition requires that Mr Ting be certified as attaining a satisfactory academic result. 2 By motion of 9 November 2005, he applied to reinstate the application.
