SZLZM v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FCA 1263 (18 August 2008) 9 The Notice of Appeal identifies no error committed by the Federal Magistrates Court and may be dismissed for that reason. No such original jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court. There is no logical reason why the applicant would not have had an official exit stamp on the false Japanese passport if he used it as claimed. 15 The Ground could potentially have been cast in terms of a contention that the Tribunal denied the Appellant procedural fairness. 28 The appeal thus must be dismissed with costs.
