Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 601 (7 May 2008) By order and direction of the Court written submissions were received on the question of costs, and these reasons address that issue. Putting aside time spent on cross-examination of Bickfords' witnesses, the reputation evidence led by Hansen was referable to both the claim and cross-claim, subject to the reputation evidence after April/May 2006 which was potentially relevant to the cross-claim only. That the Applicant otherwise pay the Respondents' costs of the proceeding. Hansen was entitled to prepare its case accordingly.
