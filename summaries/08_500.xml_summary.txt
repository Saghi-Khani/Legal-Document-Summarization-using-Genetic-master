The first appellant arrived in Australia on 15 October 1996. Particulars      (a) The Second Respondent found that the appellants' claim of fear of rape was "speculative" notwithstanding that evidence was accepted by it that indicated that "rape remains a serious problem in South Africa". On resumption, the appellants' counsel said no such application would be made. No jurisdictional error was found. Furthermore, the Tribunal accepted that the appellant had reported the incident to police. The Tribunal then considered whether there was a real chance of Convention-related harm occurring to the appellants in the reasonable future.
