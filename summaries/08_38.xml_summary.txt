2 In relation to the first and second defendants, Messrs Carey and Rundle, I excluded from the extension orders, those restraining them from leaving Australia. 23 As to the ongoing criminal investigation, Mr Carey denied any wrong doing in the management of the Westpoint Group. 13 Although the written submissions refer to a 'necessity' for travel restraints, senior counsel for ASIC properly accepted that their case was based upon their desirability. I place little weight on that matter. 6 ASIC relies in particular upon an affidavit of Ms Jan Redfern sworn 30 January 2008. He has no assets outside Australia.
