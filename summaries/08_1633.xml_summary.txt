9 Notwithstanding that the Noongar Land Council was unsuccessful in its application to be recognised as a representative body under the new regime, no party applied for an order that the Noongar Land Council cease to be a party to WAG 142 of 1998. 23 Further, the Act does not provide for any entitlement for a body to become, or remain, a party to a native title determination proceeding on the basis that it represents dissident members of a claim group. 14 I granted Mr Peter David leave to represent the Noongar Land Council to oppose the applicant's motion.
