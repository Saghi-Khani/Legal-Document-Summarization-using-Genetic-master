It does not follow that, routinely, the Court should monitor all communications between the respondents to a representative proceeding and the potential group members on whose behalf the proceeding is brought, subject of course to professional and ethical constraints. Nor is there any reason why they should not reassure their existing franchisees that the proceeding will not adversely affect the ongoing operations of the Pets Paradise franchise (assuming that is the case). The letter of notification was approved by the Court. There are two reasons for that. In this matter, I do not propose to give the approval sought.
