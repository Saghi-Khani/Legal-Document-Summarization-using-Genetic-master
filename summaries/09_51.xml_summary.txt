The applicants made the same claim against the respondents in earlier proceeding, although in connection with different house plans. I also do not recall, and have no written record or any other way of identifying, how I, or any other person employed by Porter Davis, first became aware that Metricon was offering for sale the First Respondent's Houses. According to counsel for the applicants, the admissions in [1(b)] of the Amended Reply, read with Mr Roberts' affidavit, took the issue of the applicants' knowledge out of contention. I would not accede to the applicants' application for costs.
