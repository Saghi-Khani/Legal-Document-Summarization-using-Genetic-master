Then, on 23 January 2008, AXA provided the plaintiff with a CD Rom containing the register.

The costs might be limited to variable costs or, as I would prefer, include fixed costs. A typical fee charged to supply a CD Rom copy of the data is between $50 and $300. Several examples follow. The CD Rom was not in comma delineated format.
