1 In this proceeding which was commenced on 4 September 2006 the applicant, Andrew Morton Garrett, seeks an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of Lindsay FM in action ADG 90 of 2004 in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia given on 25 January 2005. Mr Garrett was told that his first application was incompetent. I am not prepared to make an order staying the sequestration order. 8 In those circumstances, of course, the second order sought in the notice of motion cannot be made. He has not done so.
