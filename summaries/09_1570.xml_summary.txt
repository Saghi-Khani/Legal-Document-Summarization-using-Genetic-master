The approach of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, her Honour observed, derives from the decision of Sibuse Pty Limited v Shaw (No 2) (1988) 13 NSWLR 125 in which the Court adopted the test that a stay or injunction would be granted pending an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court only in an "appropriate" case. The subject matter of the litigation is the capacity or power of the Minister to deport the applicant from Australia. After a lengthy delay, the applicant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court seeking orders quashing the Tribunal's decision.
