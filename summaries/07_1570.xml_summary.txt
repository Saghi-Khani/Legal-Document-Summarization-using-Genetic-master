The proposal is that HPAL shareholders will transfer their shares to Salmat Document Management Solutions Pty Limited (the Salmat bidder) which is a subsidiary of Salmat Limited (Salmat). Prior to the hearing, counsel for the plaintiff, Mr Oakes SC, provided me with comprehensive written submissions outlining the scheme and setting out in detail the evidence necessary for me to make the orders at this hearing. I am also satisfied that the issue referred to in [27] of Investa , namely, the "vesting free of encumbrances" term is sufficiently addressed. HPAL Limited [2007] FCA 1570 (5 September 2007) See, eg.
