1 This is an appeal from orders made by a Federal Magistrate on 29 January 2007. He said that the outcome of the application for constitutional writs in relation to the decision of the Tribunal did not turn on whether or not the agent's conduct in not informing the appellant of the proposed Tribunal hearing was fraudulent. Mr Lue never told me about the hearing. He entered Australia under a business visa. He described the nature of the Falun Gong movement. 20 The appellant said that he signed the application for review which was lodged with the Tribunal.
