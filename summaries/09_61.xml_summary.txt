PROPOSED ORDER 2 --- SOURCE CODES AND OBJECT CODES  Optiver seeks in proposed Order 2 a series of documents including all versions, whether current, archived, deleted or otherwise, comprising or relating to source codes and object codes for Optiver Computer programs. That is too restrictive. He points out that the source code repository is an historical facility which stores source codes written by software developers for Tibra Global's computer programs. Optiver's solicitors will be subject to a confidentiality undertaking, and they are officers of the Court. The evidence of Mr King was not challenged.
