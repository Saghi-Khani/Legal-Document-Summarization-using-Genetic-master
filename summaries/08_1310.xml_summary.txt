Accordingly, the Commission says, the Court should make an order that Mr Smith pay its costs. Section 371 of the Act provides that the ' Court may award costs against an unsuccessful party to the petition '. 16 Mr Smith also relies on Nile at 143. In written submissions filed later, Mr Smith clarified his position. I have dismissed the petition. He asserts, and the Commission does not dispute, that the merit of his allegations will be determined in the Tribunal. An order under s 360(4) would extend to an order that the Commonwealth pay the costs of the Commission.
