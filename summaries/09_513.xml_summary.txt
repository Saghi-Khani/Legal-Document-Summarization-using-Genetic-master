In those circumstances, I consider that Mr Remta did not have a "personal" material interest in a matter that relates to the affairs of the company, for the purpose of s 191(1) , at the directors meeting on 17 February 2009. No suggestion has been made that in this case Mr Remta should not have been involved in negotiations concerning the variation of the joint venture between Aurium and GPN. Art 11.20 does not in terms restrict a director from voting on or being present when the board considers a proposed resolution.
