Nonetheless I invited submissions on costs. When delivering judgment in the principal proceeding in which I dismissed Mr Duncan's application: see Duncan v Chief Executive Officer, Centrelink [2008] FCA 56 ; (2008) 100 ALD 292 ; I ventured to suggest that this may be an appropriate matter in which to make no order as to costs. Equally well accepted are the principles informing the proper exercise of the s 43 discretion. Needless to say each party sought a costs order. See generally Dal Pont, Laws of Cost (2003) ch 8. Only the first of these is presently relevant.
