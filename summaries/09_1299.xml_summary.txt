For these reasons, I will not admit these overseas materials into evidence for the purpose of establishing that the letters "BSS" did not, as at 6 December 2006, distinguish the applicant's BSS balanced salt solution from sterile ophthalmic irrigating solutions supplied by others within s 234(2) of the Act. The respondent's case for cancellation of the applicant's BSS trade mark based on Ground 1 fails. Those letters were used by the respondent with respect to goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered. This product was introduced into Australia in October 2003.
