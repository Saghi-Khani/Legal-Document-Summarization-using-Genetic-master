SZGZW v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 457 (28 April 2006) 38 It may well be, as the learned Federal Magistrate found, that there was excessive delay. Instead, it proceeded to decide the application and made its decision, adverse to the appellant, on 23 September 1996. The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court made on 28 November 2005 be set aside. The appellant sought review of the decision of the RRT by an application dated 23 March 1995. However, his Honour recorded what he apparently considered to be the substance of the appellant's oral submissions.
