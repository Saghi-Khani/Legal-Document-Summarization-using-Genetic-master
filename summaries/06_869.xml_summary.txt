18 Finally, his Honour rejected the claim of the applicant that the first respondent had sexually harassed him, and, because she was an employee of the second respondent at the relevant time, the second respondent was vicariously liable for that harassment. 1 The application before me seeks an extension of time to file and serve out of time a notice of appeal from the decision of Jarrett FM made 12 October 2005 ( Gauci v Kennedy & Anor [2005] FMCA 1505). We propose to grant leave to appeal accordingly. THE COURT ORDERS THAT:   1. The applicant's formal complaint was not withdrawn.
