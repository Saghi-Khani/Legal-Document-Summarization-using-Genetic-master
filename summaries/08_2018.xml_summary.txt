Mr Roper eventually asked me to take judicial notice of the fact that there would be a delay. This is so because even if I were to infer that the applicants have suffered some hardship, as a consequence of the vessel being seized, that hardship is different to any hardship that may be occasioned by the costs and delay associated with the taxation of the costs in this matter in the ordinary course. I am unaware as to what their individual circumstances are. By comparison, Mr Roper says that the process of fixing a gross sum will cost $10,000.
