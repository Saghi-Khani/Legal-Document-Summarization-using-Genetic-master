This incident is said to have resulted in loss of turnover for the week ending 12 April 2007. Second, the applicant's actual weekly Turnover is calculated by reference to the sales invoiced in each week. The second construction question concerns the period of indemnity under the 2005 Policy in respect of the September 2006 incident. The amount claimed is $5,281,400. The expression Average Weekly Turnover is not defined. (For the 2006 Policy it is $183,900). This construction will preclude any liability for loss occurring after 31 October 2007 whenever the claim is made.
