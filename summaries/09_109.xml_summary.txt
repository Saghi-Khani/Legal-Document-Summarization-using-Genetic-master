The form of the Grower's Licence claimed to be a copyright document of AAC (as did the form of the Commercial Crop Contract referred to below). Mr Young filed his application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice on 21 December 2007, ten days after execution of the deed of assignment. The supplier was the "Licensor", Namoi, and "the Grower" was ICM. Mr Young's email of 3 June 2003 was also referred to. ICM challenged the validity of the assignment to Mr Young. Indeed, the Sublicence described itself in cl 1.1 as a "Seed Agency Agreement".
