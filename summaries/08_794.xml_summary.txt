Was a section 41(5) notice required? The respondent submits accordingly that the effective date of payment of $9,516 on his behalf was 14 August 2005 and that this amount relating to the 2005 tax year should have been included in item 5 of the Schedule to the bankruptcy notice, as "payments made". Second, the total amount due exceeded the amount in fact due to the extent of the omitted credits and payments. The applicant did not claim interest in the bankruptcy notice for the post-judgment period. The respondent has filed an appeal notice against the judgment.
