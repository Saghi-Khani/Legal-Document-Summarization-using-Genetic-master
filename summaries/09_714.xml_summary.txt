His Honour referred to the observations of Giles J in Re Spedley Securities Ltd (1992) 9 ACSR 83 at 85-86. Following the voluntary administration of the company, the new trustee appointed Pepper Australia Pty Ltd as servicer of the trust. I propose to make the orders which are sought for the reasons that are set out in the submissions. The reasons why the liquidators seek the Court's approval to enter into the documents is explained in the evidence of Neil Geoffrey Singleton, who is one of the liquidators of the company. The first is a power of attorney.
