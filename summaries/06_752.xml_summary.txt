He rejected the evidence of Mr Yuvarajah that a separate oral agreement had been reached with Mr Hasturk which relieved Computer World of its obligations under the credit facility to establish a separate interest bearing account as a trust account in favour of ICE 2000. He dismissed a cross-claim filed on behalf of Computer World. This ground cannot succeed. Under those principles, the $50,000 would be trust money, as his Honour in fact found.
