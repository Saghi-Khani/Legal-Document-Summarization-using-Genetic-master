It points out that Servier's solicitors are aware that the basis upon which API and the supplier provided the documents to Apotex was that the details of the identity of the supplier be redacted. It is such an inconsistency, between these documents and the documents specifying the use of Solvent 1, that Servier says it wishes to pursue. In issue in the proceedings is whether the synthesis of Intermediate B infringed the patent. The reply does not mention Solvent 1. API takes the view that the identity of its suppliers is the confidential information of API.
