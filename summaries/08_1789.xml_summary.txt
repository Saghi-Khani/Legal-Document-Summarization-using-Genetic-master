27 Therefore, the operative decision of the Tribunal on 31 May 2008 occurred after the appellant was given the opportunity to explain her absence at the original hearing, to provide any further material in support of her application, and after the Tribunal exercised its discretion to proceed despite being aware that the appellant was sick on the original scheduled hearing date. See, for instance, Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs v SCAR [2003] FCAFC 126 (2003) 128 FCR 553 at [37] . The Tribunal invited the applicant to give oral evidence and present arguments at a hearing on 9 May 2007.
