26 By letter dated 27 January 2006 Ms Obieta wrote to Ms Karen Toohey, Acting Director Complaint Handling concerning the conduct of Ms Aylett. Ms Obieta claims she was treated less favourably than Ms Fogarty. Further, as Ms Obieta has acknowledged, her complaint against the President and the Commission was not based on any racial ground. Issue 3: 'Covering up' by Commission. No message left. TAFE and Mr Norman were both given extensions to respond to the letters. It records that the submission had been received from Ms Obieta on approximately 1 September 2005. 73 Accordingly, this ground must fail.
