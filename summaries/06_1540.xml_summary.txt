The respondent submitted that the shifting articulation should count against the appellants on the question of costs. 1 On 24 October 2006, I dismissed the appeal from the decision of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and directed the appellants and first respondent to file written submissions regarding costs: Edwards v Postsuper Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1380. The third issue related to the ground of appeal concerning the meaning of "Dependant" in the trust deed. This case involved an unfortunate contest between individuals. The respondent submitted that it was therefore not an issue on which it had failed fin the relevant sense.
