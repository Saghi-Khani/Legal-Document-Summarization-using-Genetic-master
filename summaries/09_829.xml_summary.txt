Section 323(2) provides that, if a declaration is made under subsection (1) the Court may, by order, approve a Scheme for the taking of action by a collective body of the organisation, inter alia, for the purpose of enabling the dysfunctional Branch to function effectively. No party submitted that the Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the application. By Rule 49 Branch management is under the control of Branch Committees of Management. Mr Vines has a long history in the Union movement. A remedial scheme was proposed. I consider him to be an appropriate person to act as Administrator.
