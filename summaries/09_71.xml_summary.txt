Having undertaken this search, Mr Pakula contacted Mr Mario Zacaropoulos as a result of which the latter caused Pakula Lures Australia Pty Ltd to change its name to Zacatak Lures Australia Pty Ltd. Gamefish Central has the benefit of registered trade mark 753417 in respect of the word "Lumo". This was relied upon behalf of Zacatak so as to question whether Pakula Tackle had even established any standing to bring the alleged copyright infringement claim. He carried on business under this name until December 1999. It though is not the Applicant and Zacatak must meet the case as pleaded.
