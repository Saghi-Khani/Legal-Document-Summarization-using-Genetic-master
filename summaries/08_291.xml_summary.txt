There is clear evidence from Captain Wodidj and from several of his brothers that Captain Wodidj does not claim to be a member of the native title claim group or of any native title claim group which has native title rights and interests in the Town of Batchelor area. The named applicants in the amended Town of Batchelor No 2 application are Thomas Edward Petherick, May Stevens and Captain Wodidj (the second applicants), who are said to have been authorised by the Emu and Blue Tongue Lizard Kungarakan group. The fourth named apical ancestor of the Emu clan is Thullumbun.
