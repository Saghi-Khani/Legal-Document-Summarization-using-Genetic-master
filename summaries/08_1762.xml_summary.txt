It is only YRTB, the holding company, which is being placed under the control of the liquidator. The agreement also provided that all expenditure was to be authorised by Mrs Coslovich and Mr Booker. The parties adopted the suggestion and Max Kurz of KE Business Advisory Services Pty Ltd was appointed to value BBPL and find a purchaser for the BBPL shares. The sale process is continuing. In early June 2007 Mr Booker was denied access to BBPL's bank accounts. That is the reason Counsel included the condition in the terms of settlement. Little was resolved.
