Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Nuera Health Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 1756 (14 November 2007) 5 Only the sixth and respondents, Paul and Christopher Rana, have been served so the injunctions sought will be granted against those respondents. 2 Since Ryan J's order the respondents have persistently harassed the witnesses by sending them strange documents couched in pseudo-legal medieval language, including demands for some $294 million. 4 The jurisdiction to make such an order is undoubted. It involved exploiting the families of persons suffering from terminal cancer and defrauding them of substantial amounts of money.
