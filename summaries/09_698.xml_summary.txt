However, as noted, it failed to register the proposed variation by lodging notice of the proposed variation with ASIC on 5 June 2009 in accordance with s 650D(1)(b) of the CA. In my view, there is good reason, in a case such as this, to make an order in terms of proposed order 2, extending the time for lodgement of Blaze's SBS dated 5 June 2009, to 8 June 2009. Notice to shareholders is not required. It is undoubted the Court has the power to make any order under s 1322(4) on conditions.
