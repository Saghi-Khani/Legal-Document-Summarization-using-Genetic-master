Mr Ludwick and Ms Yeatman made improvements on the Bukki block, working on it every day. He was elected to the Council in about 1980 and was a member until some time after it received the deed of grant in trust over the land (27 October, 1986). The "repealed Act" was the Land Act 1962. At the time, Mr Ludwick was living at Bilma. claiming land. In my view, the effect of s 361A is to confer a right upon the owner of improvements, subject only to satisfactory investigation of the question of his or her ownership.
