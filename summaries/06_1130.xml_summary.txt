The Kamu said that, in respect of the eastern part of the Land Trust area, they were the traditional Aboriginal owners. Accordingly, the committee finds that both the Malak Malak group and the Kamu group have common spiritual responsibility for the sites and for the land in the general vicinity. There was clearly such evidence before Justice Toohey. The Committee concluded differently from the Toohey Report, that the Kamu continued to exist as a local descent group. For the same reasons, I do not accept the contentions.
