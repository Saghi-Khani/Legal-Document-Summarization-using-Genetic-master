I therefore propose to grant an interlocutory injunction in terms of paragraph 4 of the remaining Respondents' undertakings but with the qualification as to reasonable endeavours removed. Several of the orders sought, they submit, have that potential, particularly so as to prohibit businesses which might lawful be conducted. As to injunctive relief, final injunctive relief may be granted by this Court pursuant to s 32 of the Spam Act . Section 26 of the Spam Act provides for the institution of civil penalty proceedings. Prima facie, Mr Weber's affidavits show a continuum of conduct. ACMA does not submit otherwise.
