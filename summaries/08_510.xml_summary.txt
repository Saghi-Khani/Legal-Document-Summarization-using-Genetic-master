In the Tribunal, the respondents contended and the Tribunal appears to have accepted, that if the Tribunal found that there was no properly allowable deduction under s 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (the Act), Pt IVA would not require consideration and therefore there could be no penalties imposed under s 224(2) of the Act which referred to a Pt IVA circumstance. In the circumstances of this case the request made was entirely reasonable. 10 The respondents objected to the Commissioner's decision to disallow the deductions and impose penalties. Section 226L.
