Because no agreement could be reached with the respondent, the first applicants applied under s 444F of the Corporations Act for an order that the respondent not take possession or otherwise recover the Mitchell Street property. He made it a condition of the order, without saying why, that the administrators pay the costs of the application. During the proceeding the respondent also sought to amend its pleadings. Such a rule would interfere with the court's unfettered discretion in relation to costs. It would also be a licence to a landlord to unreasonably resist a claim for relief from forfeiture.
