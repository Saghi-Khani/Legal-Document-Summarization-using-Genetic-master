Progress payments are effectively payments by instalments or periodic payments made over the life of the contract for construction work already completed. 9 Lorne Bay served a revised invoice on 2 May 2008. I favour the second meaning, because the provision of a final payment claim results in the issue within 14 days of a final payment certificate. Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1248 (19 August 2008) Section 9 creates the right to progress payments at particular points in time but does not provide a definition of the expression. The invoice effectively claims three separate amounts.
