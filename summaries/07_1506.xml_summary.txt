In an open letter of 9 July 2007 to the striking employees, Mr Reidy said that "some of our employees have chosen to engage in activities... including" followed by four dot points. In that letter, Mr Reidy referred to the letter of 19 June 2007 and stated that the response received from the NUW was not adequate, that the respondent believed that the conduct alleged did occur and that termination of the applicant's employment may be appropriate. The applicant participated in that picket. Mr Simmonds also gave evidence of an incident in late August or early September 2007.
