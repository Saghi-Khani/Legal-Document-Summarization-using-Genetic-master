The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in that the Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness by reason of there being a reasonable apprehension of bias. However, the applicant claimed to be in a Labour reform camp until 6 March 2004. The Chinese document titled '[Named City] People's Hospital Diagnosis' dated 13 May 2002, concerning an examination of the applicant on 13 May 2002, only describes treatment of a head injury. The applicant's discussion of Falun Gong was trite and shallow. APPLICANT: No. MISS BYERS: It does take time. The applicant fell outside that period by one day.
