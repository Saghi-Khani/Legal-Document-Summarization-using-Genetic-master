INTRODUCTION  1 I published Reasons for Judgment in four related proceedings on 24 April 2008: see Alphapharm Pty Ltd v H Lundbeck A/S [2008] FCA 559 (the earlier reasons). ; and (2) does the Court have power to reinstate the entry of the particulars of the extension of term in the event that Lundbeck's appeal is successful? There was no claim that Arrow had infringed the Patent. 12 The extension granted was from and including 14 June 2009 to 13 June 2014. 42 There was an issue as to whether a permanent injunction should be ordered against Alphapharm.
