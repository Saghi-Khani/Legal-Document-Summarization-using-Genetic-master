The proceedings, commenced by Mr Sutherland in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, sought possession of the properties which, as indicated above, were by this time registered solely in Mr Vale's name. These two findings supported a finding that the transfer, the subject of the s 139ZQ notice, was not void against the trustee (s 120(3)(b) of the Act). Sutherland v Vale [2007] FCA 1876 (6 December 2007) Mr Johnson properly did not suggest any. Costs of the application will be reserved. Ground 3  15 The transfer made by Mrs Vale occurred on 23 April 1999.
