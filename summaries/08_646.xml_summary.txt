The appellants attack some of his Honour's fact finding. 46 For the week ending 1 October Ms Wills was rostered to work only three shifts. If she did not sign the AWA she would be employed at his "discretion". When Mr Taylor asked why, Mr Hibberd said "She wants to be paid penalty rates". Mr Hibberd said that the Tavern barely broke even. 65 Following the note of 20 August it seemed "perfectly clear" that Ms Wills' prior pattern work changed. She was called in to work one hour earlier for one of the weekend shifts.
