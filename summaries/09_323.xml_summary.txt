The application is supported primarily by an affidavit sworn 9 February 2009 by Mr Nick Jim Combis who was appointed liquidator of the company on 20 March 2008 pursuant to an order of the court winding up the company in insolvency. In addition, Mr Combis notes that on 12 January 2009 he submitted a report to ASIC pursuant to section 533 of the Corporations Act and, in all other respects, the administration has been completed. In that affidavit, Mr Combis deposes to having served the application and supporting materials upon the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation and other interested persons.
