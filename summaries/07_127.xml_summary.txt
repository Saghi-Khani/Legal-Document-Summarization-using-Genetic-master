9 The Tribunal found that at the time the bridging visa application was made, subcl 010.211(3) of Sch 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations') applied to the appellant's application. 7 Not deterred, the appellant then commenced on 19 April 2004, a further application for judicial review of the RRT's decision - this time in the Federal Magistrates Court. I, therefore, dismiss the first ground of appeal --- being Ground A. By a decision dated 20 July 2005 the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirmed the decision of the delegate to refuse the bridging visa.
