26 In my view however this litigation could not be characterised as proceedings in the public interest as in Oshlack [1998] HCA 11 ; 193 CLR 72 and Ruddock v Vadarlis [2001] FCA 1865 ; 115 FCR 229 for the following reasons. 6 The applicant filed written submissions on costs on 9 May 2007. In this case, the application of the respondent for summary dismissal was wholly successful. A person with standing can commence an action pursuant to the DD Act as to the application and interpretation of the Disability Standards and the DD Act.
