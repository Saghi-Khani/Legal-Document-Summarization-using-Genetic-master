The Minister erred in exercising his discretion to cancel the visa under s 501(2) of the Act by not properly taking into a relevant consideration, namely the best interests of the children. There is no evidence before the Minister to support that conclusion with respect to [the applicant's] children Joshua and Larni. He concluded that [the applicant's] four children under 18 all live with their mothers and [the applicant] has access to them under a court order. 21 In his Statement of Reasons, the Minister refers to the children cumulatively, singling out only one child (Darryl Holani).
