15 There is no similar obligation for the Minister to invite or consider any other comments on an assessment approach decision. Under s 75(5), the Minister is obliged to make the controlled action decision within 20 business days after receiving the referral. 4 I also reject ground nine of IFT's third amended application. I rejected that submission in the TWS proceeding. That preference mirrored the preference of the Tasmanian Government as set down in the Pulp Mill Assessment Act 2007 (Tas) which the Minister referred to at [21] of his reasons for the 2007 assessment approach decision.
