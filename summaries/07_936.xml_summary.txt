The application relates to incidents at the Smithfield Community Health Centre in late 2004 and early 2005 in which the applicant was refused access to the respondent's premises and refused services, whilst he was accompanied by his dog Knuckles and on one occasion his dog Buddy. There is no requirement in the DD Act that an assistance animal for the purposes of s 9(1)(f) be suitable for public access. I accept this submission. DID THE RESPONDENT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE APPLICANT WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 6 DD ACT ? "Trained"? The dogs in question are well-behaved.
