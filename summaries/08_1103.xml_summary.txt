First, the advertisement would have led a reasonable person to believe that the diamond in question had previously been offered for sale to the general public at a "usual mark.price" and was now being offered for sale for a limited period at a substantially lower "crazy price". 6 The case for the Commission, which is by the plea now conceded by the Corporate Defendant, is that these descriptions grounded offences against s 75AZC(1)(g) of the Trade Practices Act . The form of the advertisements differed somewhat in terms of the entitlement of the advertisement. I respectfully agree.
