The first respondent is liable pursuant to ss 75B and 82 of the Act for loss or damage suffered by the sixth applicant as a result of representation (b). For the reasons outlined in relation to the first applicant, conduct (e) towards the second applicant was a contravention of s 52 by EVP Holdings and EVP Recruitment. The third, fourth and fifth applicants were advised of the second respondent's bankruptcy on 14 September 2004. The evidence of the applicants indicates that the first respondent was aware of facts which rendered representation (a) misleading and deceptive.
