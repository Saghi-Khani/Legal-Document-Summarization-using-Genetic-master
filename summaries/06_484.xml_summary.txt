GROUND (a): INTERPRETATION OF REGULATION 1.03  20 As I noted earlier in this judgment, the now-repealed definition of 'special need relative' in reg 1.03 remains applicable in this case. Such an error of law is jurisdictional error which will invalidate any order or decision of the tribunal which reflects it. The Tribunal also considered whether the condition of the nominator constituted 'other serious circumstances' (par 52). 31 Accordingly, I reject the submission of the appellant in this respect. From Narayan it is clear that the assistance to be provided to the nominator must be substantial and continuing.
