4 The respondents sought the costs arising from adjournments occurring on:  • 11 April 2005; • 30 May 2005; • 18 July 2005; and • 20 July 2005. On each occasion the Court below reserved the costs of the adjournment. 1 The appellant, Mr Maher, has appealed from a judgment of Federal Magistrate McInnis in which his Honour ordered that Mr Maher pay costs in the sum of $2,000. Counsel also told his Honour that Mr Maher had filed an application in this Court to set aside the order which founded the bankruptcy notice.
