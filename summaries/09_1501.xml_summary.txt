The argument that s 58(1) of the FOI Act gives the Tribunal power to review a failure to make a decision is not correct. For these reasons, the Tribunal was correct to hold that it did not have power to direct either the Attorney-General or the Minister to make an actual decision on Ms Bienstein's request for access to documents. Section 15 provides for the manner in which a request for access to documents is to be made. The AAT Act is a general application. Ms Bienstein appealed to this Court from those two decisions.
