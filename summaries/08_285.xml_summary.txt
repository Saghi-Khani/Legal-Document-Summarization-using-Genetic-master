The Tribunal issued directions in all three proceedings on 21 November 2006 that Mr Maganga file and serve material relating to the victim claim. 6 Mr Maganga also said that he injured his left knee on 13 August 2003, again on his way to work ('the third injury'). 12 During the hearing in the Tribunal Mr Maganga was cross-examined, over objection, on the injuries of 1997. 40 The Tribunal denied Comcare procedural fairness in not allowing it access to the summonsed documents. Accordingly, Comcare submits that the Tribunal denied it procedural fairness in refusing leave to inspect those documents.
