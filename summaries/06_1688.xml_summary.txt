6 On 15 August 2006 Mr Jewiss filed an Amended Application and an Amended Statement of Claim. His Honour published reasons for that ruling. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to decide whether the assessments should be excluded because they were made in 'bad faith' because there is no evidence of 'bad faith' on the part of the Deputy Commissioner. 3 It is the nature of Mr Jewiss' defence and counterclaim in the District Court proceedings, and allegations in the proceedings in this Court, which give rise to the present motion. That third general assertion may be dealt with at this point.
