The Tribunal's findings on credibility referred to such inconsistencies and the inconsistencies between the evidence given by the applicant to the Tribunal at the hearing and the evidence of her migration agent and her witness. That finding was in part based on the fact that the applicant did not present her claims consistently ' throughout the processing of her application ' with reference to information in her protection visa application and the evidence given by Ms Sit, which the Tribunal accepted. Her application for a protection visa gave the first name. However, there is a strongly arguable case on appeal.
