In the circumstances I have no hesitation in dismissing his application for leave to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court of 28 April 2006. If his point concerns the hearing before the Tribunal, he was given notice of that hearing. On that date the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application to quash a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of 15 December 2005. On that document he provided a mobile telephone number. The applicant has not appeared on his motion. The affidavit develops that proposition in a subsequent ground, but simply in an assertive way.
