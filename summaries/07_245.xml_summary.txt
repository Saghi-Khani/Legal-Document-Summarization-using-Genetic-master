14 The position is therefore that there is nothing before the Court which would support in any way a conclusion that there were prospects of success in the applicant's appeal from the decision of the Deputy President made on 6 September 2006. 6 On 13 February 2006 the applicant sought internal review. The applicant failed to appear at the conference. Document T was said to be exempt pursuant to s 41. The applicant relies on an outline of submissions. Pursuant to s 42A(2)(a) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 , the Tribunal dismisses the application.
