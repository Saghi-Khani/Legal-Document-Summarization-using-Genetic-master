Subsection 97(3) of the Patents Act provides that:  Where the validity of a patent is disputed in any proceedings before a prescribed court under this Act, the court may direct the Commissioner to re-examine the complete specification and the Commissioner must re-examine the specification accordingly. Plastics denied infringement and, in its cross-claim, alleged that the patent in suit was invalid. I would order that B.M.W. VIP Plastic opposes the orders sought in the motion. B.M.W. Section 98 requires the Commissioner to make a report on a re-examination.
