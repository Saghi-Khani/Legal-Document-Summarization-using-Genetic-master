Counsel also referred to the 2001 Tribunal finding that Ms Cheung suffered from chronic pain syndrome but did not submit that an issue estoppel arose. In response, counsel for Australia Post pointed out that the decision under review which affirmed the determination of 11 April 2006 not to pay compensation to Ms Cheung for her shoulder and neck condition considered further medical evidence from Dr McGill. Ms Cheung has not established that the 2008 Tribunal made errors of law. The SRC Act is also silent on the use to be made of previous determinations, reconsideration decisions and Tribunal decisions.
