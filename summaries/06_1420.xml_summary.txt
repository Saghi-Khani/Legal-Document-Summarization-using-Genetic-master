On appeal, the appellant also referred to two other matters which he submitted constituted fraud on the part of Mr Han. Alternatively, if fraud was not established, the appellant submitted that nevertheless the advice or conduct of his agent was 'wrongful' and that that was sufficient to take the decision of the Tribunal outside the statutory definition of a privative clause decision. The Magistrate found that the agent had acted dishonestly and fraudulently. The Magistrate made an order that the application before him was not competent, 'as the Court has no jurisdiction to hear it'. 31 French J dissented.
