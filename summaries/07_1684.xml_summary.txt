62 The CDPP's advice in relation to offence 2 in warrant 1, which became the subject of par (2) in the notice, was similar in its failure to identify any act or omission of Mr Tervonen. 44 This material provided an additional basis why it was open to Senator Johnston to form the opinion that Mr Tervonen was an extraditable person under s 16(2)(a)(i). That was also before Senator Johnston. 111 At no time after Senator Ellison's s 16 notice was issued was the process contemplated by s 17 of the Extradition Act followed.
