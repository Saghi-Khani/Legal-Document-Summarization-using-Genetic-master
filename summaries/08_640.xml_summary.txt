5 The applicants' allegations of infringement turn on three questions of construction relating to the meaning of certain expressions in the patents' specifications, namely: • "opening extending therethough";  • "digging edge"; and • "a rigid lock received into said opening". Wear assemblies comprise several parts, including a "shroud", a "weld base", a "lock" and an "adjustment assembly". Mr Smith was not required for cross-examination. Professor Wightley gave evidence that he could identify "shoulders", as that term is used in claim 1 of Jones III, in the wear member the subject of Hahn. 89 I do not accept this submission of the respondents.
