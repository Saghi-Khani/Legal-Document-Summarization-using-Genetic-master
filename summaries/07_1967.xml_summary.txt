24 I am prepared to proceed upon the basis that it is open to this Court to order either indemnity costs or solicitor and own client costs. By their defence to the applicants' claim, filed in November 2004, those respondents specifically asserted that the Deed of Release did not have the effect for which the Bank successfully argued. However, they submit that those costs should be assessed in the ordinary way, on a party and party basis. That is hardly surprising. The Bank now seeks an order that its costs be paid by the applicants on an indemnity basis.
