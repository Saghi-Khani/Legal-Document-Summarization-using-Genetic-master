(d) The learned Magistrate erred in finding that the applicant's claims of a Single Hindu Tamil Woman with a political view as a supported of the Kedilan Party was properly considered. I do not accept however that this was related in any way to her race, religion, or political opinion, or that the treatment by police amounted to persecution. Further, the RRT did not accept that any harm suffered by the appellant occurred for a Convention reason. The FMC carefully considered the RRT's decision, and found that jurisdictional error had not been established.
