With respect, the Tribunal seems at times to have used "confined" in a rather loose way in describing (at para 16) Mr Collett's position in the two hours in which he was located in the surrender area. The words "held captive", much less "taken prisoner" or became a "prisoner of war", do not appear in the definition of "interned" as found in the Internment Act and the 2007 Budget Measures Act. I accept that an "other place" might be constituted by a place without any obvious physical limit other than that supplied by enemy sentries.
