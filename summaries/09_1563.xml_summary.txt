I filed my affidavit before 12pm on Thursday 10 December 2009 as directed by the Court. RAMS did not require any of the applicants' witnesses for cross-examination. On 22 November 2005, Mr Hastings and Ms Ng entered into an agreement by which Riby agreed to transfer its interest in the Underwood property to Ms Ng. On that day, her Honour made directions for trial. On 26 April 2006, the Supreme Court of Queensland ordered that Riby be wound up in insolvency and that the first applicants be appointed liquidator for the purposes of the winding up.
