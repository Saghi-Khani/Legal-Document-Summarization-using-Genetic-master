The litigation had materially contributed to the appellants' parlous financial situation. 33 South Pty Ltd v Fitzgerald [2008] FCA 1960 (19 December 2008) Denying a stay or ordering security would deny the appellants the capacity to appeal. Such consequences were clearly very relevant considerations, but discretionary reasons moved the Court to order security for costs. This is a case where granting a stay and refusing to order security would involve a "free hit" for the appellants and substantial unfairness to the respondents (in the sense identified in Tait v Bindal People at [4]).
