The Deed of Assignment is therefore not capable of assigning the TPA and FTA causes of action to Mr Sharp and understandably the defendants oppose any order substituting Mr Sharp for Pearl Coast in relation to those causes of action. The plaintiffs' Substituted Statement of Claim lodged 4 September 2007 can be divided into claims made on behalf of the first plaintiff, Pearl Coast Divers Pty Ltd (In liquidation) ("Pearl Coast") and claims made on behalf of the second plaintiff, Liquid Investments (WA) Pty Ltd ("Liquid"). Liquid is deregistered. Mr Sharp should also provide security for these costs.
