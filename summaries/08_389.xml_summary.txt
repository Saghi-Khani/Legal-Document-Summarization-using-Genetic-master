INTRODUCTION   1 On 5 November 2007 Citigroup Pty Ltd filed a notice of appeal from a judgment of the District Court of New South Wales in a matter arising under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (WR Act). I assume that on that day Judge Toner made an order requiring Citigroup to pay Mr Mason an amount which reflected his agreed entitlement if successful in respect of his claim for annual leave entitlements plus the appropriate amount of interest to the date of the order. Was the Judgment Interlocutory? Costs. Adjourn for mention to 15 October 2007 at 9.30am.
