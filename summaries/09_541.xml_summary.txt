The applicant seeks leave to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 6 February 2009 ( SZHLW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor [2009] FMCA 51). I have looked at the application for an extension of time, the affidavit of the applicant in support, and the first respondent's outline of submissions. When the matter was called for hearing today the applicant failed to appear. Order 35A r 3(1)(a) provides that if the applicant is in default the Court may order that the proceeding be dismissed.
