In the earlier action ( Miller v JLCS Pty Ltd (2007) 158 FCR 1) the trial judge, Sundberg J, granted a declaration that the respondents in that action, Harold Miller and Saul Miller (father and son), "are entitled to operate the City restaurant under the name Squires Loft". The draft made provision for Harold and Saul to have an exclusive area in which Lionel and Joel would not grant any other party a licence to use the mark. In the following year Lionel, Saul and Harold discussed the possibility of opening another Squires Loft restaurant in Goldie Place.
