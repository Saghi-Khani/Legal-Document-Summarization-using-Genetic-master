Escheat could not occur if the Crown or the mesne lord had a tenant: 10 Halsbury's Laws of England (2 nd ed) 616 [907]. However, there is no similar statutory procedure to assist a registered mortgagee in realising its security after a trustee in bankruptcy has disclaimed the bankrupt mortgagor's interest in Torrens title land. That system applied to land under the operation of the RP Act . I propose to order that the legal title of the land vest in the bank so that it may sell the estate in fee simple to a purchaser subject to conditions.
