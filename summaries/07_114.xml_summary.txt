On 20 January 2006, Cuori placed an order for these vacuum cleaners with Suzhou Fak. 24 Meanwhile, and before Mr Ding replied to Mr Stergiotis, certain things happened involving the applicant and its distribution of the MC-801 in Australia. 86 That there was, on or about 10 January 2005, a contract containing the exclusivity term was an element of the applicant's case. Mr Stergiotis responded that he could not sell the product in Australia while the design was still registered by the applicant. He said that, if so, Suzhou Fak's promise about exclusivity would be meaningless.
