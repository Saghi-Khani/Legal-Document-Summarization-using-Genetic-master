(4) Whether the Tribunal denied Australia Post procedural fairness in deciding that Mr Johnston was entitled to access particular information on the list. The second list notionally is a list comprising information directed to carrying on commercial activities and is thus not influenced by any purpose directed to reserved services. Part II of Schedule 2 specifies Australia Post, 'in relation to documents in respect of its commercial activities'. The APC Act describes the principal function of Australia Post as one of supplying postal services. The Tribunal's reasoning goes along these lines. I will then determine the question of costs.
