THE NATURE OF THE ISSUE  As outlined above, the question of law relating to the operation of the 'past act' provisions of the NTA, in particular s 228, relates to the various mining tenements granted within the area of the Martu native title claim. The parties also agree as to the persons holding any native title rights and interests not extinguished by the leases. Beaumont J reserved a narrow question of statutory construction for the Full Court in K Mart Australia Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [1995] FCA 760. The grants did not, therefore, constitute category C past acts.
