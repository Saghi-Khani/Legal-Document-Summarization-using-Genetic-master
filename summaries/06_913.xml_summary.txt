RELEVANT LEGAL PRINCIPLES   26 Order 29 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules provides that the Court may make orders for the decision of any question separately from any other question, whether before at or after any trial or further trial in the proceedings. In fact, whichever way the constitutional questions were determined, the Court would still be seised of, and would be required to determine, the central question of legal professional privilege. Paragraph 1 of AWB's prayer for relief claims a declaration that specified documents are protected from production to the Commissioner by legal professional privilege.
