Ground four The fourth ground also relates to the Tribunal's findings referred to in ground one. The Tribunal rejected the applicant's evidence (including his assertions in exhibit R2) as to the amount of time he spent on the purchase, repair and sale of vehicles. That is not a ground upon which a finding of fact may be challenged. His notice of appeal identified eleven alleged questions of law. The applicant appeared before me in person. The third issue was whether the applicant failed to satisfy the activity test within s 601(1) of the Act.
