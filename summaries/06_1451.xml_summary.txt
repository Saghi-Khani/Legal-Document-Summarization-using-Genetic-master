5 Although in a very broad sense, the documents described in paragraph (e), dealing with 'the criteria', could be described as being before the decision-maker, it seems to me that that is stretching that concept too far in the present case. 2 As regards the documents referred to in paragraph 1(a), in my view, the recommendation which went to the decision-maker expressly referred to and identified the particular reports concerned. I certify that the preceding five (5) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gyles.
