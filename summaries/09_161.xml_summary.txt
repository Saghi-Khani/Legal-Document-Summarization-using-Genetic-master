(c) His Honour erred in failing to find that the Tribunal had not considered the cumulative effect of the appellant's case for establishing exceptional reasons for the grant of a student visa. On 16 May 2008 the appellant made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ("the FMCA") for judicial review of the decision of the MRT. The MRT assessed her claim to have exceptional reasons in the following way: The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant has established exceptional reasons for the grant of the subclass 573 visa. She did not do so.
