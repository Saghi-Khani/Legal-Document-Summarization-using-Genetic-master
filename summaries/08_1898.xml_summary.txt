Refugee Review Tribunal had bias against me and did not make fair decision for my application. The Appellant now appeals to this Court. 19 No reason emerges from the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate to conclude that he did not " reasonably " consider the application before him. On 28 November 2008, the Appellant again appeared with an interpreter and made oral submissions. The Respondent Minister, however, has advanced no submission questioning the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the new argument -- but does contend that leave to raise the argument should be refused. Jurisdictional error has bee made.
