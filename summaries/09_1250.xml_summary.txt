Section 424(2) provides that '[w]ithout limiting subsection (1), the Tribunal may invite a person to give additional information'. DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE  The appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the Tribunal decision on 31 December 2008. Ordinarily, the asking of questions by the Tribunal member at a hearing would not constitute jurisdictional error. (3) If any of the paragraphs in subsection (2) of this section apply, the applicant is not entitled to appear before the Tribunal. The extant issue was whether the first respondent had been an active Christian in China.
