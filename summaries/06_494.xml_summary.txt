Federal Magistrates Court  11 The first ground in the amended application before FM Nicholls was that the Tribunal breached the notice requirements in s 425A of the Act . 13 Nicholls FM referred to the decision of Conti J in SZDQO v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1026 ; (2005) 144 FCR 251 (" SZDQO") which addressed this issue. It therefore applies to the present case. The Magistrate noted that the appellant did nothing to notify the Tribunal of his reason for a failure to attend the rescheduled hearing date, nor to seek any further hearing date.
