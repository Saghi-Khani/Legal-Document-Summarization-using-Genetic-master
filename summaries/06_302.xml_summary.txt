These representations were coupled with an alleged system whereby the company would pay the first six months lease instalments. 10 Mr Ramrakha, solicitor for the respondents, stresses that there are live factual issues and that no assumptions should be made about the truth or otherwise of the ACCC's assertions.

The company is no longer in business, and it has given an assurance that it is not selling pizza oven systems. Broadly expressed, injunctive relief is sought.
