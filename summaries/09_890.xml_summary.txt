In 2006 Mr Fisher tested three devices for acoustic level: the M15D, what has been called "the technically equivalent device" to that used in the comparison report (DM15), and the SoundShield Mk1, all in combination with a Plantronics H51 headset. More importantly, for present purposes, because a higher output could be achieved in different test conditions (with background noise), Mr McNeill's test is not a test of any limit of the M15D. Professor Blamey explained why there were only eight subjects. Plantronics does not. Mr Guest accepted that profile 1 was correct for the general 95dB (non Telstra) setting.
