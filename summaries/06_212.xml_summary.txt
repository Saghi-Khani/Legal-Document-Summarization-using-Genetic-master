By a letter dated 2 May 2000 Mr Conomos sought assistance from the respondents' solicitors in negotiating to extend the term of the Bank's mortgage until 30 November 2000. As Deangrove itself stressed, IHL apparently had good reason to be interested in purchasing the 49 units; it had effectively paid a deposit on the units by causing Islands to allot 7 323 785 shares to a nominee of Deangrove. We have now received our client's instructions in respect to the offer made by your client. Mr Buckby expressed concern that no deposit had been paid.
