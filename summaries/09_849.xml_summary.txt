The current application seems to me to be a case more in line with TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1329 where Heerey J referred to the Full Court the application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Sundberg J allowing a stay of proceedings. Even if it could be argued that the allegation of unconscionable conduct against the Group B members raised a current justiciable controversy, Allphones argues that the contractual claim does not do so. Costs are reserved. But the respondent contends that Allphones has failed to identify any relevant prejudice.
