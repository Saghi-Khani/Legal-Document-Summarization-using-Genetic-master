Equally Flinders Ports is a Pt 5.1 body, being a proprietary company. That remains for another day, assuming that the shareholders vote in favour of the scheme. 1 The plaintiff, Flinders Ports Pty Limited, seeks an order that it convene a general meeting of all of its shareholders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). In particular, the "prescribed information" is set out in detail in Pt 2 , section 12 of the draft Scheme Booklet. 3 It is not my function at this stage to determine the business or commercial efficacy of the proposed arrangement.
