Other courses which can be taken are, if a case is made out, to utilise s 447A to extend the period for which the creditors can adjourn the meeting pursuant to s 439B or to utilise s 447A to grant a further extension of the convening period under s 439A. 6 In each of these matters, namely, Estate Property Group Limited, NSD 1079 of 2007 and Australian Capital Reserve Limited, NSD 1085 of 2007, I make orders respectively in accordance with the short minutes of order which I have initialled and placed with the papers in each matter.
