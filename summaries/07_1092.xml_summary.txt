By application dated 20 October 2006 the appellant sought judicial review of such decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. FINDINGS  13 The Tribunal was unable to place any weight on the letter relied upon by the appellant as evidence of his claimed Christianity. SZJOB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1092 (18 October 2007) The appellant also has not tendered the transcript of the Tribunal hearing. That entitlement extends to the right to rebut or qualify by further information, and comment by way of submission, upon adverse material from other sources which is put before the decision-maker.
