11 The amendment to the Notice of Appeal to insert a claim for relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) did not advance matters. The appeal was against a refusal, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the 'AAT') on 13 June 2006, to grant a stay of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal ('SSAT') dated 28 April 2006. Accordingly, the SSAT affirmed the decisions earlier made that Mr Croker's disability support pension should be cancelled. 3 Mr Croker appealed to the SSAT. In my view the First Respondent should have its costs of the appeal.
