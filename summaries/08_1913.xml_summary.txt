5 The action ultimately settled when the parties returned to court on 3 October 2008 for directions. Accordingly, I ordered that Mr Missailidis' accountant file an affidavit setting out the profits Mr Missailidis derived from the three dance parties held in May and June 2008. It was agreed that Mr Kardas would discontinue his action against Mr Missailidis without any prejudice to any claim for costs. 16 Mr Kardas' total costs to date are $65,363. The second offer, made on 13 August 2008, sought payment of $27,500.
