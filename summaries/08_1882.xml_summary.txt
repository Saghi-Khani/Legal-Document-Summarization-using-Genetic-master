In June 2008 the appellant was again taken into immigration detention. 5 The appellant did not appear at the Tribunal hearing. The notice of appeal specifies only one ground, being that the Federal Magistrates Court failed to identify the fraud committed by the appellant's migration agent, who did not submit the appellant's refugee claims to the Minister or keep the appellant informed of the progress of his application. A delegate of the respondent Minister refused the application on 5 March 1997. His bridging visas expired on 20 December 2000. The Tribunal affirmed the decision on 30 April 1998.
