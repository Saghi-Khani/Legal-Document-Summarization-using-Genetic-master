The cover under cl 1.2.3 extends only to "unintentional" breaches (of any of the many provisions of the trade practices legislation referred to in cl 1.2.3 and "similar legislation enacted by any state or territory of Australia"). The insurers further say that having regard to the fact that KMF originated and managed secured loans under the Scheme, (2) of the exclusion clause excludes indemnity under the Policy for "Claims" (against KMF) arising out of the non repayment of any such loan. In this regard, the parties agree that KMF was the responsible entity for the Scheme.
