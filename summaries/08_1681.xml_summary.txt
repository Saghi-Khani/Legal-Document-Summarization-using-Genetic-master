FINDINGS & REASONS FOR DECISION  3.1 ASIC has considered the request by Mr Hartnell to inform him whether ASIC had any objection to him alone, or together with other lawyer(s) from Atanaskovic Hartnell, from representing each of the Examinees at the Examinations. The proceedings as finally constituted named ASIC, Ms Dodds and Mr Astar as Respondents and sought orders setting aside the direction made on Friday 10 October 2008 to exclude Atanaskovic Hartnell from appearing at all of the examinations. The right is conferred on the examinee's lawyer. They submitted that the power was vested in the inspectors.
