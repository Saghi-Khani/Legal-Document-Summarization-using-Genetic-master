In order to bolster it, the ACCC called Mr Shuvaly to give evidence, pursuant to the agreement to which I have referred between the ACCC and Mr Shuvaly, in [11] of these reasons for judgment and [135] of Leahy Petroleum . 8 On 25 July 2007, the ACCC and Colin Williamson filed a consent order, bearing that date, to the effect that the ACCC pay the costs of the proceeding incurred by Mr Williamson, to be assessed on a party-party basis.
