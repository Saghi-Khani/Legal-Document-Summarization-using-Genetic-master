1 At issue in these proceedings are resolutions made by Raftland Pty Ltd, as trustee of the Raftland Trust, to distribute trust income in each of the tax years 1995, 1996 and 1997 to the trustee of the E&M Unit Trust as a Tertiary Beneficiary of the Raftland Trust. Mr Thomasz said that the Heran interests were not a party to the arrangement for the payment to Harts. At that date one property had been sold for about $190 000. The same analysis applies in the present case.
