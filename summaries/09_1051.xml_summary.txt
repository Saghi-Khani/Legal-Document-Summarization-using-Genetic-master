The orders sought in that Notice of Appeal are: that as a matter of law, all the Appellant's US Social Security Administration retirement pension payments are not deductible from applicant's Centrelink pension. The payments made by the US Administration are not paid pursuant to any Australian law concerning the Superannuation Guarantee. The Agreement is Schedule 13 to the Social Security (International Agreements) Act 1999 (Cth) (the SSIA Act). The dispute is whether the appellant had been overpaid $3,021.50 in Newstart Allowance. On 15 October 2008, the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the appellant's appeal.
