First, I could rely upon s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) to dismiss the appeal. 4 In a decision dated 18 October 2005, the delegate refused to grant the appellant a protection visa and on 15 November 2005, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision. However I was provided with a medical certificate, dated 20 November 2006, that was delivered by a 'friend' of the appellant to the Court just before the hearing. Ultimately, Riethmuller FM dismissed the application.
