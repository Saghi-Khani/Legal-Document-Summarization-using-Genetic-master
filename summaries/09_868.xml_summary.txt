This dispute is between an Australian company, Bella Products Pty Ltd (BP), and a corporation established in Delaware, in the United States of America, Creative Designs International Ltd (CDI). The counterclaim asserts, as BP asserts in the Federal Court action, that BP and CDI entered into a distributorship agreement. The New York court refused the application on 28 May 2009, indicating that CDI should seek a dismissal or stay of the Federal Court action. The disadvantage concerns witnesses. Each party has tendered evidence from a practicing US attorney dealing with the jurisdiction of the New York Supreme Court.
