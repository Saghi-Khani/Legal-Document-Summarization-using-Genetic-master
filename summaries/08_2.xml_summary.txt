1 In the substantive judgment on the appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court ( Woodtree Pty Ltd v Zheng [2007] FCA 1922) I upheld the appellant's appeal insofar as it was based on its claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) but rejected its claims for copyright infringement. By a letter from its solicitors dated 7 June 2006 the appellant rejected that offer and "in order to reach a commercial resolution to this dispute" made a counter offer of $17,500 including costs and the undertaking. 10 Here the rejection of the respondents' Calderbank offer was imprudent.
