The MRT determined that the appellant was not a special need relative of his uncle at the time of decision. 15 The first respondent also disputed that the MRT misapplied the definition of "serious circumstances. The language of regulation 1.03 makes this clear. The MRT made no finding that the assistance provided by the appellant was continuing. That report stated that the nominator's levels of depression and anxiety had increased significantly. This is an appeal from that judgment. A further report by Mr Kleynhans, dated 19 August 2002, was provided to the MRT. The appellant lived in Brunswick.
