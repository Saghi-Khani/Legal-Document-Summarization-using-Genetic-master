In the course of the proceeding the applicant filed a list of documents in which he claimed legal professional privilege in respect of a class of documents. The respondent at that time accepted that the documents would be privileged and free from production, except for, as the respondent put it, that the applicant owed a prosecutorial duty to the respondent. I drew his attention to a decision of this Court in Visy Industries Holdings Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 147 and, in particular, [112] of that decision. The other members of the Court agreed.
