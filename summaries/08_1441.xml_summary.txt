All it did was to assert that "nothing that occurred during his operational service" prior to the assumed onset of sleep apnoea "in any way caused or contributed to his obesity over and above the existing fact that [he] was eating to excess and not exercising sufficiently". Dr Volker's hypothesis was that the shift work itself that Mr Gilkinson was undertaking during operational service, contributed to his being obese. I am of opinion that the tribunal made an error of law by failing to consider that hypothesis expressly in its reasons. DID THE APPEAL RAISE A QUESTION OF LAW?
