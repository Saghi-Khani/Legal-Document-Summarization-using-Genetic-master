Mr Hanks pointed to the tribunal's conclusion that the decision of the trustee that the complainant was not entitled to a TPD benefit was unfair and unreasonable. The tribunal referred to the relevant provisions of the trust deed and of the insurance policy. The Tribunal notes that the Complainant ceased work on 19 May 1999. 61 I have held that the tribunal's recourse to r 4.7 of the original rules involved errors of law in two respects. The tribunal noted that Dr Ridgway found the complainant to be partially disabled, but able to return to work.
