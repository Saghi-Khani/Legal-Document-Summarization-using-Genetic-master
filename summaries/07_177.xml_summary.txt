I do not consider that the statements given in [6] of his affidavit provide any explanation for the applicant's failure to attend before Allsop J. There is no explanation for how the legal representative is said to have stopped the applicant from attending Court. However, Mr Kumar put before me today different reasons why there may be jurisdictional error. The motion seeks, in the alternative, that his Honour's decision be set aside pursuant to O 35 r 7(2)(a), his Honour's order having been made in the applicant's absence.
