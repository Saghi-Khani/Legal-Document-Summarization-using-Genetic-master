The appellant claimed that this was known to the Chinese authorities and would result in her persecution if required to return to China. 22 The tribunal did not deal with the appellant's case that she feared persecution because of her political opinion. In its reasons the tribunal referred to country information that dealt with the ability of a person with a dissident history to leave China. 8 The appellant had a second basis for claiming refugee status. That decision was affirmed by the Refugee Review Tribunal. An application to review that decision in the Federal Magistrates Court was unsuccessful.
