WAS MR KEMP'S AUTHORISATION REQUIRED? That issue is the intended meaning of the words 'all persons who hold or may hold native title in relation to land or waters in the area covered by the agreement' in s 24CG(3)(b)(i). First, a concern that Dr Davis-Hurst and the Kattang people of the Manning Valley are not the group who hold the common or group rights comprising the native title in the Saltwater land. The critical issue to be determined in this proceeding is whether, nonetheless, the Agreement may not be registered unless he authorised its making.
