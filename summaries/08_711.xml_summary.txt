9 The respondent argued that the applicants' abandonment and replacement of the first two reports prepared by Dr McLean should attract indemnity costs. In those circumstances, a solicitor client costs order would not have been warranted. Lowe v Mack Trucks Australia Pty Limited (No 2) [2008] FCA 711 (21 May 2008) At the time Dr McLean gave this evidence, the applicants had not given discovery of this data. At trial, however, the Lowes failed to make out their case. 12 I accept that the circumstances attending Dr McLean's first two reports justify an award of indemnity costs.
