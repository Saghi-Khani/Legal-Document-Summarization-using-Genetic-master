TRIBUNAL'S DECISION   5 The Tribunal made two critical findings, namely that the appellant's reason for not coming to Australia following the grant of his permanent residence status was based upon economic reasons rather than legal reasons. However the Tribunal observed that the discretion provided by s 13(4)(b)(i) of the Act was one which was ' not normally exercised where the person is overseas '. '   7 Section 13(1)(d) and (e) of the Act impose mandatory requirements for citizenship. Such application was refused on 3 January 2006 and that decision was appealed to the Tribunal.
