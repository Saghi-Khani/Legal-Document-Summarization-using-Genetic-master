The Tribunal said, when discussing the appellant's application that it had been submitted that the appellant's fear of persecution related to his political opinion as a high profile political leader who was associated with the Nepali Congress Party and his membership of a particular social group as a businessman who was targeted by Maoists for donations. I raised with the first respondent's counsel whether that matter had been appropriately addressed by the Tribunal. The appellant had claimed in his evidence that his tenant was Mr Rajendra Dhakal. They also attacked other members of the Nepali Congress Party.
