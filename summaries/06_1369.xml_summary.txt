2 On 5 October 2006 liquidators were appointed to Lane Moller Partners Pty Limited on a creditors' voluntary winding up. 12 In the present case, Mr Cawthorn, who appeared on behalf of the appellants, submitted that if leave to proceed were required, it should be granted. 9 Ipp AJA agreed with Spigelman CJ that BPM was readily distinguishable. 10 Powell JA, the third member of the Court of Appeal, though he did not express a concluded view upon the matter, was inclined to think leave to proceed was not required in the context of an appeal.
