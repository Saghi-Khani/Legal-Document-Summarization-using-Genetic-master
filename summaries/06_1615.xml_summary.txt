6 On 11 October 2005 the Tribunal sent a letter to the mailing address specified on the application for review, stating that the Tribunal had considered the material before it in relation to the application but was unable to make a decision in his favour on this information alone and the Tribunal invited the appellant to attend at a hearing on 7 November 2005. 13 In relation to the second ground, I reject the appellant's complaint that the Federal Magistrate failed to consider the appellant's claims in relation to s 424A of the Act.
