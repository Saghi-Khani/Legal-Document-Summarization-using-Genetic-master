SUMMARY  82 As indicated above I have concluded:  (a) the respondents have waived client legal privilege in the external legal advice referred to in the letter from the respondents' solicitors to Ms Rich's solicitors dated 19 April 2005; (b) the relationship between OGC and the respondents concerning Ms Rich's allegations was not of the independent character necessary to give rise to client legal privilege; and (c) Mr Edwards has not waived client legal privilege in the legal advice obtained by him from external counsel. ...      38. Their evidence demonstrated that OGC operates as a separate functional unit with PwC.
