As the appellant had not appeared before the Tribunal, it had insufficient evidence to make any specific finding about the appellant's claims of his fear of harm by reason of being a Shia Muslim. This is an appeal against orders of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( the Tribunal ) ( SZNHU v Minister for Immigration & Anor No 3 [2009] FMCA 777). Consistent with the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate, I see no jurisdictional error in this aspect of the Tribunal's reasoning. Two grounds are new.
