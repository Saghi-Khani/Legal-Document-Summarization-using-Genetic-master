In my opinion, there is no power to award Mr Russell such costs. In respect of those issues and as I have already observed, the parties enjoyed mixed success. I shall not therefore make an order remitting the matter to the Commissioner for the purpose of amending the 2001 income tax assessment so as to increase the amount of the taxable income and the tax payable thereon. Orders Mr Russell agrees with the draft short minute of orders for the disposing of the appeals proposed by the Commissioner. Further, Mr Russell has not sought the making of any such order.
