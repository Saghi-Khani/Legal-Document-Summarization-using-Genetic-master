2 The Court Registry forwarded a letter to the appellant at the address for service on the notice of appeal on 15 September 2008 identifying that the matter had been listed for hearing in this building at 2.15 pm before Bennett J. 5 In the circumstances of the correspondence relied upon by the first respondent, I consider that I should make an order that the appeal filed on 17 July 2008 is dismissed, and I so order. There has been such a failure today. Associate:Dated: 5 November 2008 The Appellant did not appear.
