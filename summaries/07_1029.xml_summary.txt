2 On 30 January 2007 I made an order that the applicant provide security for the costs of the first, third, fourth and fifth respondents. The second respondent's solicitor, Mr Hocking, said that he regarded this also as an accurate estimate of the costs likely to be incurred by the second respondent. On that date the applicant filed a substituted statement of claim. 6 Communications and correspondence ensued. As I noted at the directions hearing on 22 June 2007, it is not for the parties by agreement to set aside the orders of the Court.
