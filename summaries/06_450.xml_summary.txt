According to Mr Waller neither he nor Mr Cattach had been informed of any Copeland compressors failing because of the TraxOil Device prior to this meeting in September 2003. On this basis the claim for breach of contract, as pleaded, is one to which O 8 r 1 applies. The remaining terms of the 2000 Agreement would be all of the terms of the 1998 Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement referred to was exhibited to Mr Waller's affidavit. Mr Kensinger said that Emerson would participate in that development program. It previously traded as Alco Controls.
