The letter also required the defendants to pay the plaintiffs' costs of the proceeding. If the Court determined that Carl had established his primary case as to the business structure, there would be appropriate declarations concerning loan accounts in favour of Carl. The prayers for relief in the fifth further amended originating process included prayers that Cockle Bay or, alternatively, the Farinhas, purchase Carl's shares in Bondi Junction, Piccolo and World Square. The Farinhas divide the question of costs into three aspects. Some further issues concerning the litigation are outlined in my reasons of 6 February 2009.
