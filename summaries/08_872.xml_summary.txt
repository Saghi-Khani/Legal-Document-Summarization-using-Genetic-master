14 All parties were content for the question as to costs to be resolved upon the basis of the submissions filed and no further oral hearing was sought. The first difficulty was the fact that on 14 April 2008, the Minister had purported to revoke the notice made in November 2007. Without the prior leave of the Court, no proceedings are to be commenced by the Applicant seeking to review the notice issued under s 16 of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 11 November 2007. ORDERS   26 The Court: 1. 7 That Motion was heard on 30 April 2008.
