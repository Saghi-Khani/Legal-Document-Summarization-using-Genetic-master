The " counter-claim " or " cross demand " relied upon by Mr Harding was said to be either: a claim for " misrepresentation ", namely a misrepresentation that Mr Harding had the benefit of a GST exemption issued by the Australian Taxation Office; or an action in the nature of judicial review to have the assessments or amended assessments upon which the District Court proceeded to enter judgment set aside and declared void. This final submission is also to be rejected. CONCLUSIONS  The Application is to be dismissed. See also: Kocic v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 1576.
