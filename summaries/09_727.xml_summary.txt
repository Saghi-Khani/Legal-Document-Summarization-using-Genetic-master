The professional conduct rules set out circumstances in which a practitioner must hand over his client's papers. The relationship between the cross-claimants and the cross-respondent broke down in April 2009 and, on 1 May 2009, the cross-respondent filed a notice of ceasing to act for the cross-claimants in this proceeding. On the same day, I decided that it was appropriate to make the freezing orders sought by the applicants ( Rafferty v Time 2000 West Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1931) and those orders were made on 19 December 2008. It is a possessory lien.
