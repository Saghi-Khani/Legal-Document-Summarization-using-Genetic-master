That the Tribunal did not consider the claimed reason of the visa applicant for visiting Australia, but considered the application before it exclusively in light of the circumstances of the group into which the Tribunal categorised the visa applicant --- namely Ahmadi Muslims from Pakistan --- is evident from the conduct of the hearing and the Tribunal's findings. Indeed the Minister conceded that, in determining whether the visa applicant had satisfied the criterion in subcl 679.224, the genuineness of the wishes of the visa applicant required separate consideration of the stated purpose of the visa applicant in visiting Australia.
