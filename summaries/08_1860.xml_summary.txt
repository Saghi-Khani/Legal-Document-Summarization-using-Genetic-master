Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Kyriackou [2008] FCA 1860 (9 December 2008) Since the commencement of the action the fifth and sixth defendants have been deregistered and the liquidation of the third defendant is imminent. In that case Hill J considered the circumstances in which a court could make a costs order without a trial. 11 I will make an order that ASIC is not required to comply with the notice to produce. 2 ASIC now seeks to discontinue the action for three reasons. The question I must resolve is whether Mr Kyriackou is entitled to take that course.
