In any event, it is clear that, by the time the order of 4 September 2006 was made, Ms Bell had already put it out of her power, and that of Living It Up, to comply with the order, by disposing of the proceeds of sale of the Mariners Place property in the manner I have described. Order 35A r 3(2)(d) also provides that, if a respondent is in default, the Court may give judgment or make any other order against the respondent. Ms Bell's third affidavit was not sworn until 18 December 2006.
