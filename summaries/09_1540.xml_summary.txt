Pursuant to O 62 r15 of the Federal Court Rules , reserved costs follow the event, unless the Court otherwise orders. In substance, the plaintiffs have established their case for liability of the defendant to pay the damages suffered by the creditors, and by raising the matters identified in s 1317S(2) of the Act, the defendant, in effect, seeks an indulgence. Although it is for the liquidator to evaluate the strength or weakness of the defences under s 588H, it is a quite different exercise when considering whether the Court would exercise its discretion under s 1317S of the Act.
