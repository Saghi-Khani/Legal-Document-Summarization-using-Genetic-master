The applicant contends that the respondent's vandal resistant batten light, which is referred to as "the Centurion", infringes the design. 4 In October 1994, Mr Thomas incorporated a new company called Cellite (Sales) Pty Ltd (Cellite Sales). However, the AVS Light and the registered design have a number of differences in their configurations. Each cap has a length equal approximately to its height. It is of continuous cross-section. The luminare is a longitudinal light fitting that houses fluorescent tubes. On 30 October 1990, the design was registered in Mr Thomas' name. It seeks relief by way of damages.
