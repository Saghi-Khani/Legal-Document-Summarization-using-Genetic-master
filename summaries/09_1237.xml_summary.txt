The Federal Magistrate found that ground one was not made out for the reasons set out at [13]-[14] of her judgment:   [13] The evidence of the applicant's claims to the delegate in the statement accompanying the protection visa application and the Tribunal's account of the Departmental interview as well as the evidence of the Tribunal hearing indicate that the applicant's claims did not relate to political opponents of the DMK but rather to high caste people. I agree. On 19 May 2009, the applicant filed an amended application. These were also matters discussed at the hearing.
