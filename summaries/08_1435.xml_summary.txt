18 Even if for the purposes of the proceeding in this Court one takes it as a given that "the Contracts and Arrangements" constituted a "contract" whereby a person performed work in an industry, there would remain a mixed factual and legal controversy as to whether any of the OMB parties were properly to be characterised as "independent contractors" for the purposes of the Independent Contractors Act . The existence or otherwise of goodwill vested in a non-bank party to an OMB Agreement may also be relevant. 27 Paragraphs 70 to 83 of the amended defence should be struck out.
