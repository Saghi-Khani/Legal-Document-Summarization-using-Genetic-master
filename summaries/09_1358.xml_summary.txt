Because it found that Ms Light's substantive application had no merit, the AAT refused to extend time under s 29(7) of the AAT Act. Light v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2009] FCA 1358 (23 November 2009) I made an order joining the Secretaries of these Departments as the second and third respondents to the appeal. Ms Light, between July and October 2008, was also receiving a parenting payment and family tax benefit on account of her daughter. Section 44(1) of the AAT provides that an appeal to this Court may be made from any decision of the AAT.
