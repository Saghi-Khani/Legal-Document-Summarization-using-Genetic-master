EMAS argued that it should be entitled to amend the writ relying principally upon O 13 r 2(1) of the rules. But, the question is whether the proceeding in the writ or amended writ was on such a general maritime claim commenced in respect of that cause of action. But, at the present time T-D is not capable of being a relevant person in respect of the barge because the demise charter has been terminated and APC Marine, as owner, has retaken possession. I would not have granted such an amendment.
