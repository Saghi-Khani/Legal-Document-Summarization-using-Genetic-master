I have already made clear my findings that the fact that the applicant brought claims under the TP Act within the arbitration is irrelevant in assessing costs. The first thing to note is that it is not necessary to order discovery of any documents that have been discovered in the arbitration, the first respondent having conceded or agreed that the documents discovered in the arbitration may be used by the applicant for the purpose of determining whether to institute proceedings in this Court. His Honour: No. Secondly, the extent of the appropriate order for pre-action discovery was also contentious.
