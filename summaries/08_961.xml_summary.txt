40 On my understanding of the facts, I do not think that the statement of claim can be amended so as to plead, in respect of superannuation, unlawful discrimination by Schering occurring after 23 June 2004 and falling within ss 14 and 18(2) of the Act. 32 In the circumstances recounted above, s 46PO of the HREOC Act was enlivened and Mr Boyn, being an affected person in relation to the complaint, was entitled to apply to this Court alleging unlawful discrimination by Schering. 25 Mr Boyn submits that he was discriminated against on the ground of his age.
