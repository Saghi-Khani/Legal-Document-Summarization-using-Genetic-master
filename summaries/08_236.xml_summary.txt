The Tribunal did not explain how the additional conditions that continued after the shoulder pain resolved were related to the claimed injury of shoulder pain. 7 On 15 October 2004 Australia Post decided that, based on medical evidence, the effects of the right shoulder injury had ceased and that Australia Post had no present liability in respect of that injury pursuant to the SRC Act ('the determination'). 11 Mr Sellick appealed from both reviewable decisions to the Tribunal. It referred to Drs Bills, Griffith, Cassar and McGill who were cross-examined. There was no evidence to support that finding.
