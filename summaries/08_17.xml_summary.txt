5 On 5 December 2005, GSA Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd (the second respondent) filed an Amended Notice of Motion seeking that the proceeding be dismissed pursuant to O 20 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules and that Australian Petty Patent No 662284 be revoked. Nor was Stack, as patentee, entitled to be granted the petty patent within the meaning of s 28(1) of the Act . The decision of Delegate Bruhn largely followed the reasoning of Cooper J in proceedings which related to an earlier provisional patent, Petty Patent No 645740 (PP1). 43 That judgment has not been appealed.
