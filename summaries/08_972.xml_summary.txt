The terms of the rule are plain. Mr Croker failed to identify any error in Cowdroy J's judgment which could have warranted a grant of leave being made. His Honour dismissed the proceedings before him as being an abuse of the process of the court and also found that they were frivolous and vexatious within O 20 r 5(1)(a) and (b): Croker v Commonwealth of Australia [2008] FCA 452. For these reasons the application for leave to appeal must be refused. Cowdroy J also asked Mr Croker how he quantified his claim for damages.
