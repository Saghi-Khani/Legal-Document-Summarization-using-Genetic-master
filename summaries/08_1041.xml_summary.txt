Paragraph 29 makes reference to media releases made by Prime. In so ordering I reserve expressly such claims of privilege in respect of documents within that category as may be just. These are in respect of the following categories of document, taking the numbering from the schedule to the notice of motion: 1, 4, 9, 22 and part of 36. Prime takes the position that Fig Tree is seeking to go behind the affidavits of documents that have been delivered. This aspect of the application fails. Complaint is made of Pt 2 , sch 1 of Fig Tree's list.
