Rejection of Dr Oates' Opinion  66 The Tribunal was also in error in suggesting that the Trustee should have rejected Dr Oates' medical opinion on the question which was assigned to him, namely, whether Mr Gilberg was totally and permanently disabled because he would not ever be able to work again in a job for which he is qualified by education, training or experience. None of the medical practitioners appointed by the Trustee under Rule 17(c) stated the view required to be stated by Rule 17(c)(ii)(B). 12 May 2001. His report is dated 7 May 2003.
