In SAD 138 of 2008, Mr Nicholls made an application on 20 August 2009 for the stay of the orders made by Mansfield J on 15 January 2009. However, he now purports to rely upon the fact that he issued proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court as a reason for staying the orders made by Mansfield J on 23 July 2009. The issue before his Honour in relation to the application by the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to inspect documents was whether or not the documents were subject to legal professional privilege.
