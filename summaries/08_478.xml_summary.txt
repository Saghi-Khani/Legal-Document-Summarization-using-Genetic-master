By a facsimile letter dated 11 December 2001 Cutler Hughes & Harris made a proposal which included the following offer:   Costs Incurred by Trustees [sic]  2. The minutes record that Mr Pantzer complied with a request to table his time costs but they do not record any motion approving his remuneration. 79 The orders made by Lindgren J on 21 October 2003 (see [2007] FCA 1589 at [22] ), although made after the filing of the cross-claim, were intended to enable the amount to which Mr Pantzer was "lawfully entitled" as trustee of Dr Wenkart's estate to be quantified.
