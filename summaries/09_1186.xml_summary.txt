The appellant also submitted that the Tribunal failed to take into account properly Mr Kleynhans' expertise and reports and also the contents of the letter from Dr Crimmins dated 11 October 2007. On 9 May 2007 the appellant applied for a protection visa. The Federal Magistrate rejected all these grounds. The appellant was given every opportunity to respond to the s 424A letters and to attend a hearing. This matter did not form any part of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision. It found his claims to be inconsistent with other evidence before the Tribunal.
