The appellant stated that he had tried relocating from Parbat to Kathmandu but still could not escape the Maoists, and he claimed that should he migrate to India, the Maoists would pursue him there as well. 12 The Federal Magistrate additionally found that the grounds for review relating to s 430 of the Migration Act related to the Tribunal's alleged failure to make findings on the appellant's documents, and observed that his Honour had dealt with this earlier. The appellant's evidence in support of his claims included submissions received by the Tribunal on 19 August 2004.
