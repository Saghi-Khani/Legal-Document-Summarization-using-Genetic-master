As in Muin , the appellant contended that certain documents containing country information that were referred to in part B of the delegate's reasons for decision, and which are said to be favourable to the appellant's case, were not provided to the tribunal. The rule extends to a failure to give evidence in relation to any aspect of the decision-making process including whether or not the tribunal had read, obtained, considered or taken into account particular documents: Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal [2000] HCA 49 ; (2000) 170 ALR 379. As a result the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application.
