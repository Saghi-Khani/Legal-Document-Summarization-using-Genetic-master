18 Counsel for the Minister raises the delay between the Tribunal decision of 21 March 2000 and the date of the application to the Federal Magistrates Court on 19 June 2008. His Honour did not infer fraud arising from that fact. 4 The appellant's evidence before Raphael FM was that his first migration agent, Mr Shi, had concocted his protection visa claims. His Honour declined to comment upon the appellant's claim that Mr Feng's explanation of why he did not turn up to the Tribunal was false. 3 The appellant has had two migration agents advise him.
