Section 24A of the ACC Act provides that an examiner "may conduct an examination for the purposes of a special...investigation". The applicant attended before the respondent on 12 February 2009 as summoned. It follows that the applicant's contempt of court point should be rejected. The respondent rejected the objection, and required the applicant to answer the question. Those restrictions were placed pursuant to directions given by the respondent. As noted above, the summons in the present case, as amended, provided that the applicant was required to give evidence of federally relevant criminal activity involving conspiracy to murder.
