BACKGROUND  On 6 October 2009, I ordered that within 7 days, VIP by their proper officer file and serve an affidavit specifying details of customers to whom they had sold composite intermediate bulk containers ( IBCs ) suitable for use in the transport of dangerous goods and which were manufactured by Schutz or their agents or licensees but which contained inner plastic containers manufactured by persons other than Schutz ( the Original Norwich Pharmacal Order ). Only five of VIP's customers' details were revealed by Mr Smith's affidavit. The question is whether Schutz have advanced any evidence to show any new risk.
