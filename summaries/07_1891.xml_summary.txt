The Tribunal considered both limbs of subclause (7A)(c)(iv), namely, whether the appellant had net assets of not less than $AUD250,000 to conduct the business or, alternatively, net assets of a lesser amount adequate to conduct the business. The financial information appears to show that the visa applicant advanced a loan of $12,500.00 to Faulkner Technologies Pty Ltd. The report also analyses the forecast of sales and at Appendix 2, Mr Thynne sets out the valuation methodology adopted to determine the value of the appellant's interest in Holdings.
