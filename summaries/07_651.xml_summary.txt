On the question of standing Olney J said (at 349) "In Re Waldcourt Investments Co Pty Ltd I expressed the opinion that the applicant's former status as a director and/or shareholder of the company is an insufficient basis per se to claim to be a person aggrieved for the purposes of [the predecessor of s 601AH(2)] and I adhere to that view". Mr Brereton will have to pay ASIC's costs. It is safe to assume that upon its reinstatement the company would ratify the payment. Mr Brereton's claim to be a creditor is contentious.
