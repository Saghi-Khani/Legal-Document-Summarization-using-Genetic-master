Mr Leonard handed the phone to Mr Mates, and Mr Dawson told Mr Mates that Kane was (in Leonard's words) "going to take him to the commission". Called by the applicant, he gave some evidence under cross-examination as to the condition of the site sheds, and of the site generally, on 31 July 2006. Of his direct conversation that day with Mr Mates, Mr Chambers said that Mr Mates requested the provision of someone to act as a general labourer, an occupational health and safety representative and a first aider. I accept his evidence. Okay. All right. Okay.
