1 An Application was filed in these proceedings on 8 August 2007 seeking preliminary discovery and preservation orders under O 15A, rr 6 and 12 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). To do so may of itself frustrate the effectiveness of any cross-examination. If the Respondent is to attend in person, albeit pursuant to an order previously made and long outstanding, it is nevertheless appropriate to have that issue resolved expeditiously. The Applicants did not respond. So much may presently be accepted. That is a matter that has been taken into account when vacating previous hearing dates.
