29 The Notice of Motion filed by the six respondents on 20 September 2006 sought orders:  1 That the Applicant's proceeding against the Respondents be dismissed. That Statement of Claim is substantially the same as had been filed by Mr Gregory Rogers in proceedings QUD130/2006. 31 On 6 December 2005, despite the respondents agreeing by consent to the judgment of the New South Wales Supreme Court being set aside, there was no appearance by or on behalf of Mrs Rogers before the New South Wales Supreme Court on 6 December 2005. No order as to costs.
