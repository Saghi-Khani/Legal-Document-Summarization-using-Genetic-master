On 7 April 2008, Hardel and Avpri were served with the within application, and the application in Action No. After I dismissed those proceedings Hardel and Avpri sought an order that CBH and Alpha pay their costs on an indemnity basis. The originating processes in the winding up proceedings both had annexed a "statutory demand" dated 18 December 2007 and an "affidavit" of James Warren Byrnes also dated 18 December 2007. Today I have made the following orders in those proceedings:  1. The statutory demand was not signed. Mrs Elizabeth Laura Low be joined as a defendant to the proceeding.
