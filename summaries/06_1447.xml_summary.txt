4 His Honour considered whether the jurisdiction pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) might assist the applicant to side-step the line of authority referred to above, but, as his Honour indicated, no ground was advanced before him which would indicate any arguable basis for establishing jurisdictional error. 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Buchanan J of 22 September 2006, which upheld an objection to the competency of an appeal to the Court pursuant to s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (the AAT Act).
