Although he did not spell his reasoning in detail, the Tribunal member must have concluded that at the time of his journey the respondent's place of employment was the Army base at Holsworthy. Conclusions  44 I reject the applicant's submissions and, accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. Section 34(4) means that the journey provisions of the 1971 Act may apply to employee B. 37 But for the accident, the respondent's journey would not have ended within the period prescribed in s 34(2)(a). The Tribunal member appears to have accepted Mr March's evidence.
