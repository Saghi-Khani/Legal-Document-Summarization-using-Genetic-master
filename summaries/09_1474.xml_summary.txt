The appeal is expressly limited to error of law, which alleged error is the sole matter before the court and is the only subject matter of any order made consequent on the appeal. Mr Culley (who had appeared for himself and his wife before the Tribunal) did not there submit that the delegate's decision should be set aside because the power of disqualification had not been exercised within a reasonable time. None of this occurred. The parties were unable to agree. The Tribunal did not consider the point and make any findings because Mr Culley did not raise it.
