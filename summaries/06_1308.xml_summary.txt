48 The question for me is whether I am satisfied that the proposed order under s 206E of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that Mr Haddad be disqualified from managing corporations for a period of five years is appropriate: N.W. Australian Securities & Investments Commission v Liban Net Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1308 (19 June 2006) In early 2004, he says that he asked Mr Dano whether he could put his company name and business address on the motor vehicle insurance business policies to which Mr Dano said, 'If you like'. What kind of insurance are we dealing in?
