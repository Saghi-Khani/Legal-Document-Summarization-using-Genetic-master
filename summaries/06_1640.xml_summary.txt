This seems to me to be a new ground of appeal which was not a ground of review before the learned Federal Magistrate. All of the grounds assert error in the Tribunal's decision. The same principle applies here. The appellant responded to the invitation, stating that he wished to attend the hearing. The Federal Magistrate supported his reasons by reference to well-established authority. 4 The appellant's claims for refugee status were set out in answers to questions in his protection visa application.
