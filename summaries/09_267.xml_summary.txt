For these reasons, the unions submitted that they should not be subjected to any penalty. On that basis I consider penalties as follows should be imposed on Mr O'Connor:  October 2005 (total: - $6,500)  (a) BCII Act (s 49(2)): - $5,000; (b) Workplace Relations Act (s 178(4)(a)(iia)): - $1,000; and (c) Workplace Relations Act (s 170MN): - $500. The action was "wildcat" industrial action. The AWU and the AWU-NSW submitted that the objective seriousness of their contraventions was low. Furlong v Australian Workers' Union involved breaches after the industrial actions in this case.
