There was an order for directions as to assessment of damages and an order for Dr Gray to pay Sirtex's costs on the cross-claim. Had it been aware of the correspondence it would, in all probability, have been advised to make further inquiries of UWA. Sirtex also draws attention to other evidence and findings of French J concerning UWA's general attitude to commercialisation of intellectual property between 1997 and 2000. Senior counsel for Dr Gray accepted that Dr Gray was bound by the findings of French J. On 23 June, the matter was again before the Court.
