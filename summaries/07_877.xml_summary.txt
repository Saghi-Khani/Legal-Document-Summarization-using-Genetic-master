ANALYSIS   (1) Proper construction of ss 120 , 120A (3) and 120A (4) of the VE Act and, in particular, the meaning of the phrase " kind of death " in s 120A(4) of the VE Act 31 The phrase " kind of death met by the person " in s 120A(4) asks a causative question. If an SoP is in force, the Tribunal must then form the opinion whether the hypothesis raised is a reasonable one. On 10 October 2002, the VRB affirmed the Commission's decision that the death of the veteran was not war-caused. That submission should be rejected.
