(b) In these circumstances, by operation of ss 149(1)(d) and 170MB(2) of the Workplace Relations Act , the 1998 Award, the 1999 Agreement and the 2002 Agreement were binding on AMRS. Mr Lang's evidence was (and I accept) that the subsequent arrangement with AMRS to provide meter reading services "was essentially the same as that between Powercor and VMM". 20 Powercor did not re-employ any meter readers after the termination of its contract with VMM. (Emphasis added. For Mr Urquhart, counsel argued that meter reading was part of Powercor's business prior to the VMM contract.
