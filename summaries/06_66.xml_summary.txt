1 This application raises the issue whether an application for a native title claim comprising a combination of applications for native title claims which previously have been removed from the Register of Native Title Claims ('the Register'), nevertheless is entitled to the benefit of the right to negotiate pursuant to subitem 11(11) of the transitional provisions in the Native Title Amendment Act 1998 (Cth) ('the Amending Act'). Section 190A imposes a duty on the Registrar to consider claimant applications for registration. The government party was required under s 29 to give notice of its intention to do the act.
