US Patent No 4 641 676 is said to disclose a portable canopy structure which has a framework that may be collapsed into a stored state and yet may be expanded and erected for use. The applicants have therefore established infringement of claims 1, 2 and 8 to 23 inclusive by each of Products A and B. The sidewalls, it is said, 'may act' on the outer end portions 'along the planar contact surfaces' to 'resist lateral and torsional deflections' of the scissor assemblies. The respondent called Mr McKinnon, whose background included a business which sold awnings and shade structures.
