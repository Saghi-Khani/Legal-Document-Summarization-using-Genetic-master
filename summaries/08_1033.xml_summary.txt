Presumably acting upon that basis Rackemann DCJ, sitting in the Queensland Planning and Environment Court, concluded that the Scarborough St premises could only be used as a pharmacy if an appropriate permit had been obtained. None of the cases seems clearly to support White's submission, and Kaderbhai is to contrary effect. It is approved, pursuant to s 90 , to supply pharmaceutical benefits from those premises. French J considered that "... the Secretary has no power to make an approval where State law would not permit the pharmacist to carry on business at the subject premises. The Secretary is plainly correct.
