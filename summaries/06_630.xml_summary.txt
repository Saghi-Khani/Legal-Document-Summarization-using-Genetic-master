On this basis the claim for breach of contract, as pleaded, is one to which O 8 r 1 applies. He said that they agreed that their two companies would enter into a Distribution Agreement under which Traxon would supply the TraxOil Device exclusively to Emerson and Emerson would market and sell the TraxOil Device in the USA. 40 Between 1998 and 2000, according to Mr Waller, Traxon developed, refined and enhanced the TraxOil Device. Traxon was responsible, within that group, for manufacturing oil level control devices. Mr Waller explained this further in his affidavit of 15 May 2006.
