The claimant group constituting the Wiri #2 claim does not represent all of the Wiri People who are said to have Native Title over the area of land in question. 1 I have before me an application by notice of motion filed on 30 June 2006 by which the applicant seeks an order that two orders of his Honour Justice Dowsett made on 6 October 2005 and 19 June 2006 be stayed pending the determination of an appeal to the Full Court of this Court. Leave to appeal the self executing order of 6 October 2005 is refused.
