Mr Sterjov gave evidence that he opened the meeting by saying that he had heard that there had been an argument between the applicant and Ms Matthew. All that can be said is that the matter was a reason for Ms McEwan's decision to terminate the applicant's employment --- a reason which the respondents made no attempt to justify. The applicant refers also to s 2(a) , (b) and (c) of the RD Act . I uphold La Kosta's defence under par (c) of s 170CM(1) of the WR Act . Ms McEwan gave evidence to the same effect.
