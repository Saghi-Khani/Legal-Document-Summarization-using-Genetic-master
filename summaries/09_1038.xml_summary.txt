Section 30(2) of the ACC Act relevantly provides:   (2) A person appearing as a witness at an examination before an examiner shall not:      (a) ... (b) refuse or fail to answer a question that he or she is required to answer by the examiner; ...    Sections 30(4) and (5) concern "use immunity" in certain circumstances in relation to the information provided at an examination. I have come to the view that there is, in the present circumstances, a real risk that questioning the applicant on matters directly relating to the charge may interfere with the administration of justice.
