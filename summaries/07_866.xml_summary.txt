The respondent claimed to have been diagnosed as suffering from 'war caused PTSD [post traumatic stress disorder] and major depression' . The principal purpose of the definition of each of PTSD and alcohol dependence is to permit a determination as to whether the SoP applies to the condition as found by the Tribunal, presumably upon the basis of a clinical diagnosis. A reference to DSM-IV disclose that the criteria listed in each of the SoP in question reflect those identified in DSM-IV as necessary to a diagnosis, albeit in a summary form. The Commission appeals from that decision.
