Mr Spencer says that that statement was only directed to Greenwood J determining his application for leave to act as a director under s 471A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act") and not to his application for leave to appeal the decision of Logan J. In his decision, Spencer v Neo Rock Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 845 at [5] , Greenwood J set out the circumstances surrounding the hearing before him on 3 August 2009. This appeared to be a complaint that he was denied procedural fairness.
