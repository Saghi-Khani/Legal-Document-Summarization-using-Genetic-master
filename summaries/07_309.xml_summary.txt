Nokia Corporation v Cellular Line Australia Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 309 (8 March 2007) 1 This judgment concerns the costs payable by the third respondent to the applicant in these proceedings. The Court made orders accordingly. 4 At a directions hearing on 15 December 2006, the Court gave the applicant leave to discontinue against the first respondent, on the basis that the applicant's costs be taxed and paid forthwith. In setting a gross fee, the Court must be "confident that the approach taken to estimate costs is logical, fair and reasonable": see Beach Petroleum at 123.
