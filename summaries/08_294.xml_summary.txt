It is to be noted that there are some 20 Heritage Plates that are also to be on offer at the auction tomorrow, none of which are number plates which the applicants are entitled to use by reason of arrangements they have with the respondent and its predecessor. In that regard, black and white are the two colours, if they may be so described, that appear on both the V-Series and the Heritage Plates. What I have said in relation to the first representation applies to the first part of the alleged second representation. I disagree with that submission.
