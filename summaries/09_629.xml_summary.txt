Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (In Liquidation) v Victorian Families Retirement & Investment Group Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 629 (9 June 2009) In his affidavit, Mr Khatri deposes as to the steps taken by the liquidators to market the client book of Victorian Families' business for sale. (2) A court will not approve an agreement if its terms are unclear. Its role is not to develop some alternative proposal which may seem preferable. I note that this morning in Court Mr Cowen, on behalf of the liquidators, has also filed submissions in support of this application.
