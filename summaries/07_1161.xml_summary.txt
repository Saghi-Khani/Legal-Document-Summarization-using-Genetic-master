(5) Comcare shall determine the degree of permanent impairment of the employee resulting from an injury under the provisions of the approved Guide. The applicant contends that having regard to the definition of the terms 'impairment' and 'permanent' in s 4(1) of the SRC Act and the factors to be considered in determining whether an impairment is permanent set out in s 24(2) there can be no doubt that Mr Parker has suffered an injury resulting in permanent impairment by reason of the total loss of the use of his right eye. ( Canute v Comcare (supra) [14]).
