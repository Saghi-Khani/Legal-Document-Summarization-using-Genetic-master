31 The appellant submits that, in light of its findings, the Tribunal must have reasoned that if the war-caused injuries alone prevented the respondent from undertaking certain types of remunerative work which he had undertaken, then that was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s 24(1)(c). As from 1 August 2004, the respondent's cervical spine condition would not have prevented the respondent from continuing the remunerative work he was undertaking. 20 The Tribunal found, however, that the respondent's cervical spine condition would not prevent him from undertaking work as a storeman or general farm labourer.
