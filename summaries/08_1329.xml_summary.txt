1 The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of Sundberg J on 30 July 2008: TS Production LLC v Drew Pictures Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1110. The issue before me is not the substantive question of leave, but whether the application for leave should be heard by a single judge or by the Full Court. 8 Mr Rebikoff argued that the only prejudice alleged by the applicant was the cost of the US proceeding. After considering the rival opinion evidence of two American lawyers, his Honour found that US law would be applied.
