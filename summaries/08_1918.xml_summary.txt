It was submitted that the valuer must value the land as required by the Determination. 54 Mr Nicodimou used the taxpayer's construction budget as an estimate of the cost a hypothetical developer would have to pay to complete the project, which the Commissioner accepted as an appropriate estimate. 41 Upon reading the evidence of Mr Nicodimou, I do consider he failed to take into account actual sale prices after 1 July 2000 although such were available to him. Accordingly, on this basis the valuation is invalid. I do not agree. I would include such rates within 'holding costs'.
