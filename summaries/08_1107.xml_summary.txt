Subject to the provisions of s 32AA(2) , Mr Carantinos's application to this Court is a proceeding that s 32AA(1) provides must not be instituted. 6 It is not in dispute that the Federal Magistrates Court has jurisdiction in respect of the justiciable controversy between the parties concerning the respondent's entitlement to obtain a sequestration order in respect of Mr Carantinos's estate. Notwithstanding the agreement, the respondent purported to serve a bankruptcy notice and present a creditor's petition. The application will therefore be dismissed. SYG 722 of 2008 in the Federal Magistrates Court.
