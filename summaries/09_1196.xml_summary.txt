Three of Mr McCallum's relatives wish to table material by way of written statement, explaining the impact of the loss of Mr McCallum on their lives. In the substantive proceedings before the Court the applicant alleges that the respondent has contravened s 16(1) of the Occupational Health & Safety Act 1991 (Cth) ("the Act"). The parties have come to an agreement regarding the Court's reception of such material, subject to the exercise of the Court's discretion (TS 12 October 2009 p 2 ll 25-33 and p 3 ll 19-21). The respondent admits the contravention.
