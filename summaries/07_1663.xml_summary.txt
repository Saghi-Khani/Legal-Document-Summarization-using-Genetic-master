Because Ms Burgess was suspended from employment without pay with effect from 18 October 2006, the amount per week of the earnings that Ms Burgess would receive were she not incapacitated for work is demonstrated to be zero. However, the normal weekly earnings are subject to a potential reduction by operation of s 8(10) of the SRC Act. Had the incapacity not arisen, the employee would not have received any earnings and put simply, there would be nothing that might be the subject of compensation. The amount thus determined is subtracted from the adjusted normal weekly earnings.
