C & S Systems Pty Limited v Custom Security Services Pty Limited [2006] FCA 1392 (18 October 2006) I do not propose to repeat the reasons for judgment given by the learned Federal Magistrate. Order 2 restrains IPS from opening the security control panels, or otherwise interfering with the security systems of clients or customers of CSS. Mr Arthur concedes that the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief was an exercise of his Honour's discretion and that it is necessary for him to point to an error of principle in the making of orders of 2 and 3.
