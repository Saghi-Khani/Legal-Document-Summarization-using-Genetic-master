The High Court has stressed that the reasonableness of any complaint of apprehended bias is "to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice": Johnson at 493. From time to time, a judge may also indicate to counsel that she or he is taking some necessarily tentative view on an issue. â€¢ My ruling that Mr Spalla's affidavit of 1 June 2005 was inadmissible. Mr Spalla has not yet retained new representation and is currently proceeding in person.
