A brief description of the two schemes for which approval is now sought is to be found in what I said when ordering the convening of the scheme meetings: see In the Application of United Medical Protection Limited [2007] FCA 631. In substance the transfer of an insurance business from one insurer to another to create a merged and larger operation. These passages make clear that the court does not simply act on the views of members. Nothing is served by going over old ground. What other circumstances the Court may take into consideration I will not attempt to forecast.
