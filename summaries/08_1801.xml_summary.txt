23 Mr Keith's view was that Damilock was not insolvent prior to 12 February 2007, and became insolvent some time between that date and 14 March 2007. The trading statements show the profit of $416,000 during January. 93 Mr Lewis also addressed the trading situation of Damilock. Mr Keith did not dispute the quick assets ratio analysis, or its role. He accepted that. 63 I do not consider that evidence supports an assertion of any particular arrangement with that creditor as at 26 December 2006 or thereafter to grant $2m extended credit for any particular period.
