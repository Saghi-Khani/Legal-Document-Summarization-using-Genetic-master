From Ms Bishop's evidence it appears that there were only three tour bookings with HFAT, involving six individuals, which were made during the period October 2008-January 2009, but for which HFAT did not have records. In my view Mr Rhys Thomas did not take the HFAT booking records. Ms Chaloner's evidence First, I consider that Ms Chaloner was a credible witness. Evidence of the respondents Finally, Mr Rhys Thomas denied removing the HFAT booking records from Hangar 5. The lessee of the office space in Hangar 5, Broome Airport used by the HFAT business was actually KS.
