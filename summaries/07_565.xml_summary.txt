Under s 424 the RRT may invite information from an applicant before a hearing. 18 Section 425 of the Act provides:   '(1) The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. 7 The appellant responded by letter dated 30 December 2004. His comments were invited. 22 First, s 424C says nothing directly about whether a hearing should, or need not, take place. The learned Federal Court of Australia erred in law.
