8 At present there is pending before the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Queensland, an appeal from a decision given by Byrne J on 13 July 2007, in which his Honour dismissed an application which, in essence, sought to challenge the arrest warrant I have mentioned. 6 One may note that the position ought not be any different were it the case that, in some way, it was the Judiciary Act 1903 that was called in aid in respect of the application. For that reason I consider only s 9A of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act .
