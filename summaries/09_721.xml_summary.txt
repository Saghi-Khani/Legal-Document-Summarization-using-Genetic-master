Diakyne said that the reference to the "value" of shareholder capital must be given effect. Accordingly, on completion of the share sale agreement, Colorado was entitled to a payment of $100,000 under paragraph 1 of the bonus provision in the Colorado contract. Further, I am satisfied Mr Ralph was aware from no later than September 2007 that, if and when Colorado presented its invoice for the bonus payment to Diakyne, there was a real chance that the other directors of MediVac (noting that MediVac owned all shares in Diakyne) would take steps to dispute payment if possible. Percentage requirements?
