In any event Mr Flanigan accepted the possibility that the coal might be burnt, thereby producing additional greenhouse gases which might cause climate change. We contend that when the ultimate greenhouse gas emissions are considered the proposed action is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance, including the World Heritage Areas. However the EPBC Act required Mr Flanigan to address the impact of the proposed action, not the impact of the world-wide burning of coal. Clearly, an action is only to be assessed pursuant to Part 8 if it is a controlled action.
