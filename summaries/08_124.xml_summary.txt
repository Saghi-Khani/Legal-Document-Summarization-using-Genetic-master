3 In relation to the present application for reinstatement, the Tribunal decided that the review application had not been dismissed in error because Mr Jones, the applicant's representative before the Tribunal in 1996, had in fact acted within his instructions when lodging a withdrawal of the review application. 13 The second ground of appeal alleges that the Tribunal failed to consider specific material relevant to the application for reinstatement. 12 The first ground alleges that the Tribunal's reasons disclose jurisdictional error and breach rules of natural justice. None of these grounds are established in the present case.
