Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship *Comandate* [2006] FCA 881 (22 June 2006) 9 In this matter, the plaintiff has not yet filed any claim in personam. She was concerned that if the relief now sought were not granted and the English court acceded to effect the defendant's application for an anti-suit injunction there was a risk that any Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claim may not be entertained in the arbitration proceedings in London because of the combination of the arbitration clause and the governing law clause of the charter party. You are on Notice.
