In relation to its chief competitor Nestl√©, Cadbury has, for its own commercial reasons, permitted a use of purple in relation to popular chocolate products. 105 Darrell has since at least Christmas 2000 used in its marketing, packaging, promotion and point of sale presentation a purple colour much like that used by Cadbury. The Darrell Lea brand name appears prominently. Cadbury's Dairy Milk is a milk chocolate product. I felt this branding architecture across the Cadbury chocolate range would reinforce the distinctiveness of the brand and build the reputation for quality that the Cadbury brand had with most consumers.
