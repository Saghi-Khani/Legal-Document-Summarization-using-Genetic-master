9 Mr Travaglini said that in light of the failure of Stiven Jakovich to sign the consent orders he instructed Price Sierakowski to make an application seeking orders to ratify his appointment as liquidator and to vary the Family Court orders so that as liquidator he was duly authorised to exercise all powers without restraint to deal with the assets of the company and the creditors' claims pursuant to Pt 5.4B through to Pt 5.9 of the Corporations Act in respect of the winding up. Consent orders were signed on behalf of Vjeko Jakovich and Loretta Jakovich.
