The contraventions of s 187AB arose from later industrial action on 25 and 26 August 2003 when an organiser imposed bans on another building site in order to force Caelli to reverse its decision to refuse payment. On the basis of those facts, the fourth and fifth respondents admitted that they contravened s 187AA(2) by accepting payment from Multiplex in circumstances where Multiplex would contravene s 187AA(1) by making the payments. The amended policy provided that productive work would continue following a death in the industry whilst safety audits and rectification were undertaken.
