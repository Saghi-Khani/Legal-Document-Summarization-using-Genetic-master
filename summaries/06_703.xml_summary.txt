On 4 August 2000 Hely J dismissed an application for review of the Tribunal's decision on the basis of non-attendance ([2000] FCA 1138). 10 The application for leave to appeal was accordingly dismissed and I ordered that the registry not receive for filing any further process from the applicant. The Federal Magistrate found that there appeared to be no reasonable prospect of success of his application placed before the Court, and in those circumstances, the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application as an abuse of process. No particulars were provided to support the claim.
