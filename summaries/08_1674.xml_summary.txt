6 The appellant, by letter dated 17 September 2007, requested an extension of time to respond to the Tribunal's letter until 1 November 2007. The Tribunal found that the appellant could relocate within India to an area where the CPI(M) was not active and would still be able to express political opinions without facing any real risk of persecution. I see no error in the primary judge's approach to this issue. The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the appeal on 30 June 2008. Relying on independent country information, the Tribunal did not accept the appellant's evidence.
