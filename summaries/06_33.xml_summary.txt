The Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("the Tribunal") determined in the exercise of a power conferred by section 67 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 ("the SRC Act ") that the Respondent pay the costs incurred by the Applicant of a proceeding before the Tribunal (concerning a review of a claim by the Applicant for compensation under the SRC Act ) up to and including the date upon which the Respondent made an offer of settlement and thereafter, the Applicant bear his own costs of the proceeding. 90 The Tribunal properly had regard to the letter of offer in exercising its discretion.
