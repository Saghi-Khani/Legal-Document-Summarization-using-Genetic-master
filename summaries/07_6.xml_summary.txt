That information was part of the reason for the Tribunal's adverse finding in relation to the appellant's credibility however all of that information was contained in the photographs that the appellant gave to the Tribunal at the hearing and was covered by the exception in s 424A(3)(b). The Applicant said that this particular demonstration had taken place in May 2000. 5 The Tribunal did not believe the applicant's claims. Presumably these are the five photographs of an anti-war demonstration that the Tribunal refers to as having been provided by the appellant at the hearing.
