Mr Hardy's evidence made this clear. That purpose can be re-expressed as one to protect Woolworths' takeaway liquor business in the Tweed Heads area from potential competition, and consequent potential loss of sales, from a redefined or relocated licence. Woolworths submitted that Mr Smith's memorandum of 9 November was only a commentary on why Woolworths had objected to the application and not the purpose of entry into the deed. Price was a factor. Fourthly, Dr Walker used data that was aggregated across (i) stores, (ii) products and (iii) States. The question of market is dealt with later.
