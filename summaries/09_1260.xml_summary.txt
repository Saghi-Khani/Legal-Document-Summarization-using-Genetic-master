By a very recent amended defence the third respondent (Castleworld) raises a new plea. Verge v Devere Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1260 (22 October 2009) The applicants say it is those elements, taken together, that lead to an inference that Castleworld acted fraudulently for the purposes of the indefeasibility provisions of the TLA, and as pleaded by Castleworld, in order to procure registration as the registered proprietor of the Dongara Land, for the purpose of defeating the applicants' claimed interest in the land. Once, again I emphasise that none of the pleaded facts is yet established.
