By simply restating the same grounds upon which the appellant relied before the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellant is, in effect, simply contending that Raphael FM fell into error by failing to find jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal on the grounds previously asserted. The Tribunal noted firstly that the appellant, in the original application and in the statement I earlier described accompanying that application, claimed to be a stateless Bahari, however, the evidence indicated that the appellant had obtained a Bangladeshi passport. The documents were referred to in the Tribunal's decision and in the S424A letter.
