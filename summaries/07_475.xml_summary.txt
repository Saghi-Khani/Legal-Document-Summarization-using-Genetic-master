For that reason I must dismiss the present appeal, the bringing of which is misconceived in any legal sense. 2 The proceeding before the Federal Court was commenced by way of notice of appeal filed by the applicant on 3 January 2007. I granted that application and made orders to that effect pursuant to O 6 r 9 of the Federal Court Rules . Mr Druett appeared in person, and purported to appear on behalf of his four children as well as himself. Hence the sole remaining respondent to the proceeding is the Tribunal. The Respondent did not appear.
