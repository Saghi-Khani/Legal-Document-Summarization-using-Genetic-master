The Tribunal concluded that it could not be satisfied that the appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason should he return to the PRC, due to his involvement in the demonstration on 13 March 2006 or other activities in Australia about which the appellant was, in evidence before the Tribunal, uncertain. The subsequent affidavits simply re-agitate the merits of the appellant's claim. Secondly, the Tribunal failed to consider protest activities undertaken by the appellant after the application for a visa. The Tribunal referred to a Country Information Report No.
