The Respondent seeks particulars clarifying the acts and facts said to constitute the alleged 'attempt' by Mr Sarracino to obtain legal advice from the Franchisee's solicitor. 1 On 8 February 2006, the Respondent filed a Notice of Motion seeking particulars of various paragraphs of the Applicant's Statement of Claim. The information sought is a request for evidence and not a proper request for particulars. 29 The Applicant objects to all requests for particulars relating to paras 12 and 13 of the Statement of Claim on the grounds that they are not a proper request for particulars.
