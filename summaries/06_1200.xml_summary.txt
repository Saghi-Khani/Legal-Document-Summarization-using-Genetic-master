The first three documents relate to legal advice given by Mallesons Stephen Jaques to Bankers Trust International PLC ('Bankers Trust') and then subsequently provided to the applicants. I accept that such documents, while not formal opinions of the law, may constitute legal advice and, if prepared for that dominant purpose, may attract legal professional privilege. Further description of the claims for privilege was provided in a letter dated 16 August 2005 from the solicitors for the applicants to the solicitors for the respondent. Mr Tiffen has not given any evidence concerning these documents or the circumstances of their creation.
