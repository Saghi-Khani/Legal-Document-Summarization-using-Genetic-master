The Federal Magistrate treated the appellant's complaint about the nature of questioning by the Tribunal and the allegations of "bullying" by the interpreter as being separate to the allegation of bias. The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. The applicant stated that it was in 1999 (evidence shows that it was 24 July 1996). The Tribunal asked the applicant when the leader of Falun Gong left China for the US. The appellant also said that the Federal Magistrate should have listened to the tape of the hearing before the Tribunal.
