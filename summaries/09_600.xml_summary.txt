The applicant contends that in order to make an assessment under Part IVA that the applicant obtained a "tax benefit in connection with a scheme", the Commissioner would be required to form a view, by reference to s 177C(1), that the relevant amount of the tax benefit "would have been included, or might reasonably be expected to have been included" in the assessable income had the scheme not been entered into or carried out. The respondent says that the present application for particulars is, effectively, an application for particulars of the applicant's own case.
