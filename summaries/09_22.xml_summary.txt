INTRODUCTION  1 Mr Ferdinands has applied for leave to appeal from a decision of Lander J given on 3 December 2008. 14 Mr Ferdinands was convicted by a Defence Force Magistrate of one charge of assault upon an inferior officer on 4 November 1999. It was necessary for the extension of time to be granted because r 25.06.1 of the High Court Rules required the application to have been made less than six months after the making of the termination order. That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not.
