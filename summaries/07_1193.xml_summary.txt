The Tribunal made a decision on 31 December 2004 affirming the delegate's decision to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa. His Honour observed that the Tribunal referred in detail to the appellant's evidence at the Tribunal hearing on 20 October 2004, and specifically referred to his second category of claim, as follows:  The applicant confirmed that he believed that Buddhists are subject to general discrimination amounting to persecution in Bangladesh. 24 This finding was clearly limited to the rejection of the appellant's claims concerning events personal to him. The Tribunal found the appellant generally incredible.
