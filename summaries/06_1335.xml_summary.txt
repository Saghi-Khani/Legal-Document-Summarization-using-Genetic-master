2 On 22 September 2006 I published my reasons for judgment in this matter, as a result of which the second and third applicants applied to amend their statement of claim. 5 The application was very late being made after trial and after the Court's reasons had been exposed. I found that the second and third applicants did not establish any loss or damage in accordance with their pleading. 11 The respondents had been on notice since November 2005 that expert evidence would be led to support a claim for loss and damage in accordance with the proposed amendment.
