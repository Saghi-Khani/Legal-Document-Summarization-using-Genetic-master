5 The Tribunal considered the first appellant's claims but could not find any supporting evidence to suggest the Congress Party or the police harmed Akali Dal (Mann) members. The paragraphs do not state the findings of the first Tribunal. The matter before this Court is whether the Federal Magistrate was right in dismissing the appellants' application for judicial review of the second Tribunal's decision. It did not fail to deal, and did in fact comprehensively deal with the issue of the first appellant's credibility.
