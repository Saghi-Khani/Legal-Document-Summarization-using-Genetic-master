The second decision was quashed by an order of the Federal Court, following a contested appeal hearing. " Having considered the third Tribunal decision carefully, I do not consider that the third Tribunal has clearly dealt with the unconsidered claims identified by Jacobson J in their full context. The appellant made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the third Tribunal decision and on 11 December 2008, that application was dismissed. Mr Cleary appeared for the first respondent. The Tribunal failed to have regard to some evidence and claims which were before the Tribunal.
