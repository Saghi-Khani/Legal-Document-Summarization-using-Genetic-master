Schutz contends that each time VIP offers for sale the CB 1 type cross-bottled Composite IBC, it falsely represents that the IBC has been certified by the relevant competent authority for use in the transport of dangerous liquids in Packing Groups 2 and 3 (the Certification Representation). The regulatory regime does not consider that warning labeling is necessary in the case of non-dangerous goods. Composite IBCs are manufactured under the Schutz and ECOBULK trade marks. Tests are conducted on a production sample. The UN Model Regulations require that Composite IBCs contain standardised labeling.
