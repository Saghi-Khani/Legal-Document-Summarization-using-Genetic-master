" he wrote, "Told them that we were commencing a legal action against Niugini Mining". 68 Mr Salfinger replied on 9 March. Nor, for that matter, is there any such evidence of authorisation of Mr McCordic to execute the first assignment on behalf of Crocodile. Power of Attorney:  1. The litigation rights would be assigned to a new company (lets call it NewCo).
