16 Taking a broad and overall view of the outcome of this case, I consider that both AWB and the Commonwealth achieved a substantial measure of success. 6 I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration, reflecting my reasons for judgment, that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents, and does not attach to other specified documents. 19 AWB also sought the costs of its notice of motion dated 19 June 2006 and the first respondent's notice of motion dated 24 July 2006. I extended that order by consent until the hearing and determination of the proceedings.
