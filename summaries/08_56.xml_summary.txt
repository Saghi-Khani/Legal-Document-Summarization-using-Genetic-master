" (Emphasis in original. I would note in passing that s 13(1) of the AD(JR) Act does not apply to such a refusal decision: see s 26(1A) of the FOI Act. The statement did not include a reference to the FOI Manual. Centrelink, though, did notify Mr Duncan on 4 October 2006 that as he had been sent a copy of the FOI Manual on 8 August 2006 there was no basis for his request for reasons made on 25 July 2006. )   The s 9(2) obligation to make s 9(1) documents available is not unqualified.
