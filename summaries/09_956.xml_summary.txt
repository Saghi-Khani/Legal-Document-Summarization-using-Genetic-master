By Notice of Motion dated 11 August 2009 the Respondents have sought orders under O 10 r 1(2)(f) of the Federal Court Rules ("the Rules") that this proceeding be transferred to the Western Australian District Registry of the Court. The hearing of the present application has taken place in Perth this morning. The Court must weigh those factors in each case. "   In my view the preferable course is for me, as docket Judge, to continue to direct the pre-trial management of the proceeding. The power conferred by s 48 recognises the national character of this Court.
