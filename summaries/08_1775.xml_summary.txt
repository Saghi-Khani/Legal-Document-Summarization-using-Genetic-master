The True Retail Value representation  16 It is said there is a representation that the "true retail value" of MSWD's suits is $699 or $799 whereas this is not so (FASC par 8(d)). About this time the Walter Withers Collins Street store opened with a supporting television campaign. They had a swing tag with a price of $799. The second suit free offer only applies to black sticker label suits. Mr Jackson did not reply. MSWD never stated in any promotion that all of the suits sold in Walter Withers stores were made exclusively for it.
