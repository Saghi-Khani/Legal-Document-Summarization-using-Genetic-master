Pascoe v Ambernap Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 1975 (19 December 2008) Pendarves has been in members' voluntary liquidation since January 2008. 3 It appears that the sole asset of Ambernap is shares in a company called Pendarves Estate Pty Limited. The sole member and director is Mr Jon McArthur. The liquidator of that company is Mr Manfred Holzman. Mr McArthur was made bankrupt by a sequestration order made in the Federal Magistrates Court on 26 March 2008. 5 In those circumstances, two issues arise on the present application. Mr Pascoe was appointed as Mr McArthur's trustee in bankruptcy.
