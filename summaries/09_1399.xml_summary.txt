Having regard to cl 11.5 of the draft deed, it is in Mr Mark Tonge's interests for the deed to be approved at a meeting of creditors. The trustee of the Barr Trust is no longer the company but rather FUFM. The Deputy Commissioner also pointed to the absence of any particular evidence as to the nature and extent of voidable payments which a liquidator might recover for the benefit of creditors. FUFM is not presently a party to the proposed deed of company arrangement. Such an amended assessment was made on 20 November 2009.
