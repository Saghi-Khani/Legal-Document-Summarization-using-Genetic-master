In the present case, however, the Tribunal's reasons for decision clearly record that the appellant was questioned with respect to his departure date but was unable to provide that information to the Tribunal orally. In the absence of the transcript, I am not satisfied that the Tribunal relied upon the information in the visa application form regarding his family's involvement in the PPP. The respondent opposes leave being granted. The law relating to this ground was not uncertain at the time of the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court, and the appellant was represented at that hearing.
