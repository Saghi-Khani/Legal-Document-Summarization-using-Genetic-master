The Applicant said at the hearing before me that he claimed to have converted from the Sunni faith to the Shia faith on 12 March 2005 but in his response to the Tribunal's section 424A letter he said that his kidnapping, which he claimed had occurred because he was a member of a Shia organisation, the JYP, had occurred on 9 March 2005. The reference to 'the issues arising in relation to the decision under review' is important. (b) There were inconsistencies between his application for protection visa and his oral testimony before the Tribunal.
