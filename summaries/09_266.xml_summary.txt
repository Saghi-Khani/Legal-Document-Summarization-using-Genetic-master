An appropriate order in the circumstances in my view would be that the usual order be made and that Mr Bunn pay Metcash's costs on a party and party basis and that the costs be taxable forthwith. There is, it should be said, a very real question, as Lander J indicated to Mr Bunn over three years ago, as to whether the terms of Order 3.5(c) are probably "too wide". Mr Bunn has filed no affidavit and has not provided any written submissions in this matter. publication. Nonetheless, I consider his conduct censurable.
