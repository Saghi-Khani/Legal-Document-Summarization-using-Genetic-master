Mr Zentai's motion seeks to restrain the Republic of Hungary from prosecuting eligibility proceedings before a State magistrate. 7 On 11 May 2007 Mr Zentai filed an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the decision of the Full Federal Court. That appeal was dismissed by the Full Court and an application for special leave to the High Court is pending. 4 Initially a hearing before a magistrate to determine Mr Zentai's eligibility for extradition under s 19 of the Extradition Act was listed for 13 February 2006. Bail continues on reporting terms.
