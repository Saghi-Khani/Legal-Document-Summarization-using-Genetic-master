This includes, relevantly, particulars as to the monetary value of the benefits pleaded. THE APPLICATION FOR LEAVE  8 The particulars under challenge concern paragraphs 5, 10.6 and 10.7 of the defence. Devere and Packham are the first and second respondents to those proceedings. Defence: paragraph 5  10 Paragraph 18 of the statement of claim alleges that the consideration which Devere gave for the transfer of the Andonys' undivided one-third share of the Land was at most $45,000. There is no suggestion that the Trustees could not meet such a costs order.
