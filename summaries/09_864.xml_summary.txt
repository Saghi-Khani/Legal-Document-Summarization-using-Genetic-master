In my earlier reasons, I suggested this may amount to a confiscation of the client creditors' money in favour of the trade creditors. To the contrary, the liquidators say that not to provide compensation would be unfair. The jurisdiction of the court to approve a scheme of arrangement is derived from s 411. The minutes of the meetings disclose that the creditors agreed to the schemes by substantial majority in both number and value. The Opes companies carried on stockbroking and related businesses. No doubt more actions will be commenced. I do not propose to repeat what I there said.
