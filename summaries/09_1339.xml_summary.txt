As to the first ground, the Federal Magistrate correctly concluded (at [33]-[41]) that the Tribunal had discharged its obligation to consider the appellant's request that it take telephone evidence from two witnesses. Nor can I see any problem with the Federal Magistrate's conclusion that the Tribunal's approach revealed no jurisdictional error. [ 37 ] The applicant was clearly told that the Tribunal was of this mind, and given an opportunity to present witness statements. Moreover, it is also apparent that the Federal Magistrates Court gave careful consideration to each of these grounds of alleged error by the Tribunal.
