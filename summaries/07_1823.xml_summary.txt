2 The applicants seek an order that costs be taxed and paid forthwith, and that in respect of half of the costs of preparation and trial, these be taxed on an indemnity basis. Those orders were made following my judgment in the matter which was delivered on 28 September 2007: Barrett Property Group Pty Ltd v Metricon Homes Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1509. However the question before me concerns the conduct of the respondents in relation to the related issues of derivation and copying. 30 This case was complex both factually and legally. The proceedings commenced on 5 March 2007.
