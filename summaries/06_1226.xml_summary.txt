The third stage of the process occurs when a magistrate conducts proceedings under s 19 of the Act to determine whether the person is eligible for surrender in relation to the extraditable offence. Where a non-judicial power is purportedly conferred, constitutional incompatibility is ascertained by reference to the function that has to be performed to exercise the power. As I have already said, any public appointment made, or public function conferred on a magistrate, by the Commonwealth will not be made 'under the law of another place'. The applicants rely upon three grounds. I do not accept this submission.
