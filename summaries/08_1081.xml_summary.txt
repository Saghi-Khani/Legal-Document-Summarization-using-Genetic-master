Mr Bellman said that apart from telling Mr Booth about the Octapharma transaction he told him he was looking for investors so that LFE could "move forward into the future". 2 LFE is a holding company. An allotment of 15 per cent of the capital on LFE would raise only around $1.35 million. 12 The directors (now Messrs Bellman and Milne and Ms Calhoun) discovered on 19 or 20 May 2008 that Bell IXL had acquired a substantial shareholding in LFE. In the main, however, it resulted from the sale for US$5.9 million of two collection centres.
