26 In my opinion, none of the grounds raised in the notice of appeal, or in the additional submissions warrant a finding that the Tribunal committed any jurisdictional error in determining the appellant's application. I can find no evidence in the Tribunal's reasons or in other material appearing in the Court Book which supports such a serious claim. FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT   7 On 27 June 2007 the appellant filed an application seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. The appellant replied to this letter on 17 April 2007. It was properly rejected.
