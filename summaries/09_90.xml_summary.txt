Accordingly, this ground of appeal must also be rejected. Scarlett FM set out the test stated by the High Court in Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte H [2001] HCA 28 ; (2001) 179 ALR 425. The appellant's claims were set out in a statutory declaration to which the Tribunal referred in giving its reasons for the decision. The appellant claimed that she had been treated unfairly, because the Tribunal described her evidence as "vague". SZMKU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 90 (11 February 2009) The third ground of appeal was said to be unfairness.
