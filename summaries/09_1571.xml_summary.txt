The respondent seeks an order that the applicant attend a medical examination. Second, the applicant has given evidence on oath in an affidavit about his feelings concerning and consequential upon the termination of his employment. Third, the respondent says the evidence is potentially relevant to the question of whether the applicant has mitigated his loss, by seeking or obtaining alternative employment. This is because the applicant's counsel has made it clear beyond any doubt that the medical report is not relevant to any of the claims in the proceedings. The applicant does not agree to do so.
