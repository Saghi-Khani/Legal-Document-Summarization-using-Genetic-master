One provision of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 (Cth) requires note. Mr Kronen then failed to attend his next appointment set by Maxima, which was for 1 May 2008. (2) Subject to this section, the Secretary may require a person who has entered into a Newstart Activity Agreement to enter into another such agreement instead of the existing one. )   I would note in passing that the stipulation that the Agreement is "to be negotiated" is central to Mr Kronen's appeal. Though the Tribunal's reasons are slight when dealing with the non-payment period, they disclose no error.
