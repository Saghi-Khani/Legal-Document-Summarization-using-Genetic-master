The Tribunal found that the decision notification letter, which was dated 30 June 2006, was sent by prepaid post on 30 June 2006 from a place in Australia to the applicant's address in Australia, which was provided by the appellant to the Minister for the purposes of her receiving documents. Section 412(1)(b) requires that such an application for review must be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed time period. Department of Immigration and Citizenship failed to notify me the decision of my application for a protection visa. In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.
