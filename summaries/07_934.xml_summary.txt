Breach of trust deed  38 The third cause of action is that, through the first respondents, the manager would be acting in breach of the express and implied terms of the trust deed if it moved for the voluntary wind-up of the trustee. It is also said that the Court was not directed to the solicitors' letter of 11 April 2007 which alleged the breaches by the trustee. That advice identified a stratagem to eliminate any scrutiny of the manager by an independent trustee. 22 The first respondents held a meeting on 9 March 2007.
