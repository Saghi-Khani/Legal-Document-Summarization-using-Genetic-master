Multiplex submitted that these documents should only be inspected by the applicant's counsel and solicitors who had signed confidentiality undertakings. The power to order the exclusion of persons from a hearing should only be exercised in exceptional cases. I reached the conclusion that in order to preserve the subject-matter of ASIC's claim for public interest immunity privilege I was compelled to make orders under ss 17(4) and 50 of the Federal Court Act in order to avoid prejudice to the administration of justice. 28 I reject this submission. ASIC has produced the documents to the Court.
