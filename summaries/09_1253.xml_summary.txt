On 31 October 2007 the applicant wrote again to my Chambers and stated that the parties proposed that the respondent provide any objections to the proposed fourth amended statement of claim by Monday, 5 November 2007. On 12 May 2009 I made orders extending the time within which the applicant had to file its evidence on the respondents' motion for security for costs and to comply with orders made on 8 April 2008 relating to discovery. On 3 October 2006 the applicant's solicitors changed for the second time. The respondents must pay the applicant's costs of the application.
