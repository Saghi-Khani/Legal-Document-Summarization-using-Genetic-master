Section 122 of the Evidence Act sets out the circumstances in which this client legal privilege may be lost. Servier has accepted the obligation of providing evidence of its reasons for seeking to amend the Alpha Crystalline Patent. The evidence concerns Mr Hamer's views. 2 Apotex Pty Ltd ('Apotex') has served a notice to produce on Servier. There, the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered. 3 Servier claims privilege over those documents. It follows, Apotex submits, that privilege in them has been waived.
