8 Rares J held that the magistrate in that case had failed to consider a relevant consideration in addressing the question under s 19(1)(d) and for that reason the proceedings lacked any lawful authority ( Brock [2007] FCAFC 3 ; 157 FCR 121 at [115] ). Rares J declined to grant any further relief to the applicant including an order for release. Section 21 only provides for one kind of review. Tervonen v Finland [2007] FCA 2067 (20 December 2007) There is little controversy as to the conduct of a review of a decision based upon s 19(2).
