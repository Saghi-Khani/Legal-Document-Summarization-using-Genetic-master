The relevant question is whether Mr Piotto was prepared to enter into a Newstart Activity Agreement; see s 624(1)(c) of the Act. In doing so, counsel for the respondent relied on the Tribunal's decision in Dunn v Secretary, Department of Employment and Workplace Relations [2007] AATA 1031. MatchWorks provided these services to Mr Piotto and others on behalf of Centrelink. The proceeding arises from decisions in 2007 by Centrelink to impose "Newstart participation failures" upon Mr Piotto for Mr Piotto's alleged failures to enter into Newstart Activity Agreements without a reasonable excuse.
