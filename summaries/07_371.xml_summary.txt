In relation to unconscionable conduct founding a cause of action not mediated by any discrete doctrine -- Baumgartner v Baumgartner [1987] HCA 59 ; (1987) 164 CLR 137. 35 I would therefore grant the application to strike out the further amended statement of claim dated 5 October 2006, as against the ninth to fifteenth respondents. These are my reasons. 40 The reference by his Honour to the use in s 51AA of the term "conduct that is unconscionable within the meaning of the unwritten law" as identifying particular categories of case should be accepted as indicating the proper construction of s 51AA.
