Upon pronouncing judgment, counsel for the respondents sought to make submissions in relation to an alternative order for costs that ought to be made on the basis that the usual order was not appropriate in light of an offer in writing put by the respondents to the applicant on 4 August 2008, prior to the hearing commencing on 8 and 9 August 2008. The applicant acted reasonably in taking that forensic and legal controversy to Court. A party may make an informal, yet preferably clear and precise, offer to settle a proceeding at any time.
