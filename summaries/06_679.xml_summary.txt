Accordingly, subject to compliance with the regulations, the plaintiff would be entitled to vote at the adjourned decision meeting under s 439A-439C of the Act on Friday 23 June 2006 as a creditor of Charben in respect of both the debt of $1.4m which has already been admitted and also in respect of the plaintiff's costs and disbursements. Now, under the new Insolvency Act 1986 (UK), unliquidated claims in tort may be made in any insolvency administration, whether of an individual or a company. The costs of the appeal were therefore properly added to the debts provable.
