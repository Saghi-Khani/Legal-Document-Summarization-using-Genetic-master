The practice of this Court in relation to taxation appeals is set out in O 52B. A document entitled Amended Appeal Statement was filed on behalf of the Commissioner on 15 September 2009. It has been observed in prior authority that the purpose of the appeal statement is one of informing a taxpayer of the Commissioner's view, at that time, of the bases of the Commissioner's rejection of an assessment objection. Mr Prescott deposes in his affidavit to the particular consequences which he apprehends would fall upon Pacific Exchange in the event that leave to amend were granted.
