GROUNDS BEFORE THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE 8 On 5 May 2006 the appellant applied for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal. The appellant sent the Tribunal a letter dated 13 February 2006 acknowledging that the application had been late lodged and explaining that this had occurred because his Migration Agent, Dr. Zahirul Hoq Mollah, had failed to contact him to inform him of the decision of the delegate of the first respondent. Information was not forwarded to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Error of law on the face of the record. No appellable error was made.
