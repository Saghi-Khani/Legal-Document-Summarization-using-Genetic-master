Both appellants claimed that they would be arrested if they returned to Sri Lanka. The Federal Magistrate erred in being improperly influenced by the Tribunal's decision and not independently considering whether the appellants' fear was for a Convention reason. 9 At the hearing, the appellants' first ground was not pressed. As to the first matter, I am not satisfied that any jurisdictional error attended the Tribunal's approach to the issue of the reporting conditions. The Tribunal had taken a different view based on the information it had, which it was entitled to do.
