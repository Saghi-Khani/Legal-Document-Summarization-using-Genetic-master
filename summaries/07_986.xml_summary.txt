As with the gift of October 1987, for the purpose of only considering this alternative claim, I shall treat the agreement of 25 March 1989, and the payments made under it, as giving rise to an equitable interest in the subject properties in the hands of Optquest. However, on 28 April 1988 Mr Dwyer entered an appearance on behalf of Mr Vasiliou in the Supreme Court proceedings brought by the Deputy Commissioner. For reasons which I have explained above, I find that evidence to be false. It's clear. Mr Vasiliou's address was given as 18 St Kilda Road.
