The Tribunal further observed that the only Convention reason conceivably open to the appellant on the basis of the evidence which she provided was the ground of persecution based on membership of a particular social group. Additionally, the appellant claimed that she might well be harmed by her community in the Ukraine because of a perception that she would have money upon her return from overseas. 9 The appellant filed on 2 March 2004 an application in the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. Your Honour, plainly there are humanitarian aspects in this case.
