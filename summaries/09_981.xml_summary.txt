The insurer refused Ms Purcell's total and permanent disablement benefit claim, as did the trustee. The 16 December 2002 report from Dr MW referred to Ms Purcell "struggling to work a full day". The determination of that issue requires a consideration of whether the Tribunal had material before it to justify a conclusion that Ms Purcell was capable of a return to full-time work. There also was evidence that she performed administrative duties in the later employment. PROPER REASONS  Counsel for Ms Purcell submits that the Tribunal gave no proper reasons for its decision.
