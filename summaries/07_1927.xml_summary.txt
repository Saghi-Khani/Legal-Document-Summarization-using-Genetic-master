8 The issue has significance because, by letter dated 15 February 2007, the Tribunal invited the appellant to the handing down of its decision in relation to his application to  review the decision of the Minister's delegate refusing a protection visa. 6 On 17 January 2007, the Tribunal received further information from the appellant concerning Falun Gong practice in which he had engaged during and after December 2006 in Australia. The appeal is from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court SZKLV v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2007] FMCA 1406. Accordingly, I shall fix the costs at $2,700.
