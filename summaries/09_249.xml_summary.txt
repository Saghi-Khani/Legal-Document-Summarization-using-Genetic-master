The Commission has also led evidence in relation to another purchase by the ninth defendant of a property from Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd. That purchase remains uncompleted. It is a public company. The relevant amounts or transactions are as follows. I therefore propose to make orders appointing a provisional liquidator of Elite Wealth Builders and Retail Treasury and orders restraining Ms Hawkins and Mr Weerappah from applying for passports or leaving the country. According to the Commission, a number of investors invested money with Dollarforce Financial Services Pty Ltd in circumstances where their funds appear to have been dissipated.
