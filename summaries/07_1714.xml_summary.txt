On 7 November 2007 I found that Mr Siminton had committed a contempt of the Full Court's order by failing to make the $50,000 payment (or that part of it which he had the capacity to pay) in a timely manner: see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 8) [2007] FCA 1612. Mr Siminton had no legal right to hold and use these funds. Mr Siminton has been in default of the Full Court's orders since 2 October 2006. 15 For these reasons I adjourned the further hearing of this stay application until 15 November 2007.
