Perhaps it was thought necessary to claim as nominated person because some exploitation occurred prior to grant. GST also relies upon the fact that Grieves was not a party to the previous proceedings. Each patent is derived from patent application No 85236/91 filed on 30 August 1991. (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the terms, or the method, may be agreed before, during or after the exploitation. Issue estoppel is not raised. The inclusion in the definition of an 'alleged' invention is also relevant. See Stack v Brisbane City Council [2004] FCA 354 at [13] - [15] .
