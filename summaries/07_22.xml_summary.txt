In this instance, the AAT heard two matters together. 3 Both the applicants' application to the AAT and this application were instituted in the South Australia District Registries of the AAT and of this Court respectively. 1 Motion of the second respondent to transfer the proceeding to the Victoria District Registry. Order 30 r 1(2)(a) uses the term "trial" to include any interlocutory hearing. In my view, the directions hearings in the AAT therefore took place in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. The appeal must be heard by the Full Court: s 44 of the AAT Act.
