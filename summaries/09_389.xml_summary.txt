On 14 April 2009, Mr Watts filed a Notice of Motion in which he sought an order:  To admit additional evidence as contained in the affidavit of Gambhir Watts sworn 14 April 2009 to the hearing before His Honour Justice Foster on 10 December 2008. Mr Skinner, who appears for the first defendant today, does not oppose my receiving that material on that restricted basis for that purpose. The annexures, with one exception to which I shall come shortly, comprise documents which all pre-dated the hearing which took place before me on 10 December 2008.
