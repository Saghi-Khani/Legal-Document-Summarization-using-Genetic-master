This was because the Federal Magistrate did not make any specific factual findings by reference to the evidence, as to the conduct comprising the contraventions of s 337. As to the contention that the Federal Magistrate should have taken into account that Mr Hanssen deliberately inserted false dates for the purpose of concealing the appellant's failure to comply with the Act (presumably s 337(1)) in respect of the nine employees, that submission cannot be accepted. The appellant has appealed against this penalty. The tenth AWA was undated. They were purportedly dated by employees on 21 June 2006.
