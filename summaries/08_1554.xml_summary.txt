2 Section 60(2) of the Act provides: An action commenced by a person who subsequently becomes a bankrupt is, upon his or her becoming a bankrupt, stayed until the trustee makes election, in writing, to prosecute or discontinue the action. 1 This appeal is from a decision of a Federal Magistrate dismissing the appellant's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice: Rana v Chief of Army [2008] FCA 518. The refusal to set aside the bankruptcy notice does not affect the extent of the claims the appellant may still pursue under s 60(4).
