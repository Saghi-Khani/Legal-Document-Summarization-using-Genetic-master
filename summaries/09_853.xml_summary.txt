In fact, the cheese was not produced in the South West of Western Australia. During the period 23 November 2008 to 25 January 2009, the respondent also caused advertisements to be published in newspapers circulating in Western Australia advertising the availability for sale of the cheese. The Court takes into account the public interest and assesses whether the proposed orders are at least consistent with the public interest. Accordingly, I will make orders in terms of the minute of proposed consent orders. It is important, therefore, that in making representations as to product origin the respondent complies with the law.
