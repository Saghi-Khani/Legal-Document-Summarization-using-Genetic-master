2 Section 151 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) provides:   (1) If an unlawful non-citizen is to be, or is likely to be, removed or deported, this Act does not prevent a court issuing for the purposes of the administration of criminal justice in relation to an offence against a law a warrant to stay the removal or deportation. 22 Section 198(6) of the Act would have the effect in the present case of requiring an officer to remove or deport the applicant from Australia "as soon as reasonably practicable".
