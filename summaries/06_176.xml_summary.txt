In relation to the husband's inconsistent evidence, McInnis FM relied on the decision of Marshall J in MZWMQ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1263 (" MZWMQ ") to determine that the appellant's husband was an applicant before the Tribunal and that accordingly, s 424A(3)(b) of the Migration Act 1954 (Cth) ("the Act") operates to excuse the Tribunal from having to give written notice to the appellant of the evidence given by her husband. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL  5 The Tribunal accepted that the appellant is a national of Cyprus.
