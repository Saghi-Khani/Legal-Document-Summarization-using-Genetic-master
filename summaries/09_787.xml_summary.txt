As Tracey J observed in Stuart-Mahoney at [40], the relevant considerations include: The respondents' conduct consisted of a brief stop work meeting and a short-lived ban on crane work. The penalty on the second respondent is within the permissible range, albeit at the upper end of that range. LCR Lindores Group Pty Ltd ("LCR Lindores") was engaged by Bovis to undertake crane work at the Site. The applicant also seeks pecuniary penalties for the contraventions of s 38 of the Act. I accept this submission. Cruse v Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union [2009] FCA 787 (29 July 2009)
