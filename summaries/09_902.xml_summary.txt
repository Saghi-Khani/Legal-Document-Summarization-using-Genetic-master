Reasonable speculation as to whether the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution does not require a possibility inconsistent with the RRT's own findings to be pursued. This is an appeal against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing the appellant's application to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( the RRT ) for jurisdictional error ( SZNCZ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2009] FMCA 466). The RRT must not foreclose reasonable speculation about the chances of the hypothetical future event occurring. To the contrary, the RRT "comprehensively disbelieved" the appellant and his claims (at [47]).
