10 The Tribunal, which made its decision before the publication of NBGM , concluded that Art 1C(5) had no relevance to the appellant's application for a protection visa because he had not, as an individual, been recognised as a refugee when he came to Australia. The appellant had asked the Tribunal to take evidence from his father. 14 I conclude that to accept the above submission would be to disregard [25] of the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice in NBGM . The Tribunal considered s 36(3) of the Act to be determinative of the appellant's application.
