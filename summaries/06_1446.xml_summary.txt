QUESTION 1  38 Ringrow argued that an estoppel arose because Hely J, on BP's application, made orders under cll A14.2(f) and A16.9(a) for the payment of costs and expenses incurred by BP prior to the commencement of the proceedings before him. It said that this followed from a consideration of the right of termination given under cl A13, to which the reasons of the High Court also referred. None of the guarantors was a party to the option. Many costs could arise out of defaults by Ringrow under the POSA within cl A14.2(f).
