Mr Moore was the second respondent. 5 Before those appeals were heard, Mr Moore was declared bankrupt by order made on 21 January 2005. Mr Macks was appointed the trustee in bankruptcy of his estate. 3 On 14 July 2007, Lander J gave judgment in Wilson v Manna Hill Mining Co Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 912 (the primary action). That appeal is also listed for hearing on 15 May 2007 in the Full Court. As Mr Moore opposed the motion unsuccessfully, the costs of the notice of motion should be Mr Macks' costs on the appeal in any event.
