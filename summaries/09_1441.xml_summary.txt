These scratch cards were aimed at obtaining subscriptions to the Respondent's "Moby Planet" mobile phone content services. I consider many ordinary and reasonable people would be unlikely to do so. The error was corrected in the red scratch cards. When the latex panel on the yellow cards is scratched away the prize code and SMS instructions appear but, unlike the red scratch cards, there is no reference to any mobile subscription service. DID THE RESPONDENT CONTRAVENE SECTION 52 OF THE ACT? First, it is necessary to identify the relevant class of people to whom the scratch cards were distributed.
