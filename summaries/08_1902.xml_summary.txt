On 4 March 2008 the first to sixth and the eighth respondents filed and served a Notice of Motion seeking summary dismissal of the proceeding or an Order striking out parts of the Statement of Claim. 16 A draft document was handed to the parties by the applicants' solicitor on 20 November 2008 entitled "Second Further Amended Statement of Claim" (which is the fourth attempt to plead the matter). I gave liberty to re-plead the case within 28 days. 6 On 1 April 2008 the ninth respondent filed a similar Notice of Motion but also claimed Security for Costs.
