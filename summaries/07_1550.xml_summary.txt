I also ordered that the respondent pay unpaid entitlements, including interest. That has some significance because, on 10 August 2004, the maximum penalty for each offence was raised from $10,000 to $33,000. No further AWA was filed and there was no certified agreement applicable to the employment, thus the Award applied at all material times. Sharpe v Dogma Enterprises Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1550 (3 October 2007) There is no prior conduct of this kind although, of course, they were not in business for very long. I then stood the matter over for a hearing on penalty.
