The plaintiff has adduced several translations of board minutes of the owner in which reference is made to the owner's debt to the plaintiff. The second is evidence that in any event Al-Enazy was duly authorised to sign the agreement and the agreement/mortgage on its behalf. It also claimed ongoing interest. If there is no further amended defence, the plaintiff may seek to further amend the notice of motion to seek judgment. In each of those letters there is an unequivocal acknowledgment of the mortgage of the vessel by the owner in favour of the plaintiff.
