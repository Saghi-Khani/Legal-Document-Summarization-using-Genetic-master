Mr Battersby was not, he said, aware of any instruction being issued by any officer of DIAC to WAPOL that Mr Morrison was not to be allowed to make any phone calls. She did, however, make two calls to Ms Roberts on 9 May 2007 following the removal of Mr Morrison. Such other Orders as the Court may consider appropriate. I accept this is so. It follows that the Minister clearly had the power to cancel Mr Morrison's visa. INTRODUCTION  1 The applicant, Mr Morrison, is a citizen of the United Kingdom. This evidence is disputed.
