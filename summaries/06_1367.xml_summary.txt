In particular, Mr Bray noted that neither Lifetime nor MLC had disclosed to Lifetime policy holders that the effect of the Lifetime Scheme was to reverse an earlier scheme, confirmed by the Court in 1997, whereby MLC transferred part of its life insurance business to Lifetime. As with MLC policy holders, the appointed actuary's conclusion is that Lifetime and National policy holders will not be adversely affected as a result of the schemes. • All assets referable to those policies will become assets of the relevant MLC statutory fund. The applicants are ' life companies ' within the meaning of the Act.
