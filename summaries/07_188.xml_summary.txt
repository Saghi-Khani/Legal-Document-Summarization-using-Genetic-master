The respondent Commissioner of Taxation assessed those repayments as liable to fringe benefits tax under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (Cth) (the FBT Act) in the FBT years ended 31 March 2000, 2001 and 2002. The question raised is whether on those facts the loan repayments were "in respect of" the employment of Mr and Mrs Slade by the Company. 1 Mr Robert Slade and his wife Mrs Corinna Slade are the sole shareholders in the respondent company Slade Bloodstock Pty Ltd (the Company). The Company's business could not have operated without their work as employees.
