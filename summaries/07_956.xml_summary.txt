1 On 4 June last, pursuant to s 1322(4)(d) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act), I ordered that, for the purposes of s 723(3) of the Act, the time within which the plaintiff might make an application for the admission of unsecured convertible notes issued pursuant to the plaintiff's prospectus dated 16 May 2007 (the Prospectus) to quotation on Australian Stock Exchange Limited (ASX) be extended to 24 May 2007. No person had, at the relevant time, yet applied for any securities. 9 It is for these reasons that the relief was granted.
