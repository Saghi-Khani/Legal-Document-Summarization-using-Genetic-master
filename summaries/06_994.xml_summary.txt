In publishing the reasons, I gave directions for the further conduct of the trial with a view to resolving matters which would, upon resolution, lead to the making of dispositive orders. 2 The application for the stay was heard on Thursday, 27 July 2006 at 10.15am. 4 The respondents have filed an application for leave to appeal from the judgment and leave is sought pursuant to s 24(1A) of the Federal Court Act 1976. The matters that remain to be dealt are these. Those proposed declarations are to be the subject of submissions and further consideration.
