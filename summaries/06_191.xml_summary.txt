Mr Gray said that Telstar was going to loan Mr Coggin $65,000 for a business venture for a Mr Joe Nagy, who was the son-in-law of Mr Coggin, for a term of three to six months and the vessel was to be collateral. Nor was he aware of the arrangement recorded in Mr Cunningham's note of 24 December that Telstar would receive 10 per cent of the price of sub-distributorships sold in Victoria. They took Mr Coggin to the office of Telstar. Some time after February Mr Nagy took the lids back.
