The claims being advanced by the present Appellants depended upon the claims being made by the father. That Court heard both applications together and dismissed both applications: SZNCT & SZNCU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 233. Compliance with the procedural requirements imposed by O 43 before such an order may be made is dispensed with pursuant to O 1 r 8 of the Federal Court Rules . The written submissions filed on behalf of the Appellants have been considered with some care. Two separate applications for review were thereafter made to the Refugee Review Tribunal. The appeal then proceeded.
