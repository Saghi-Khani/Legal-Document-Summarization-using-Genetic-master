The defendant is treated as if he conducted his business and made profits on behalf of the plaintiff. While accepting that each sale of an infringing article is a separate act of infringement of each patent, which is separately actionable, counsel said it was impossible to "disentangle" T1 from T2. His affidavit is confined to gross and net profits and losses in each year made on infringing products. However, for the reasons already stated, the present case seems stronger against allowing any set off. Black & Decker Inc v GMCA Pty Ltd (No 5) [2008] FCA 1738 (20 November 2008)
