On 17 August 2005, that application was dismissed by Riethmuller FM. Some of that material related to the position of Dalits generally in Indian society rather than the particular circumstances of the appellant. His Honour rejected the contention that the Tribunal had not given the appellant sufficient time or opportunity to present his case. MZWQW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 23 (31 January 2006) 7 The appellant did not attend the hearing before Riethmuller FM. I agree. An application for review of that decision was lodged on 29 March 2004 with the Tribunal.
