2 Jessup J was determining whether leave to appeal should be granted from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate. In appropriate circumstances the Court can exercise an implied statutory power to set aside an order made in the absence of the party where the absence was through no fault of that party: see also SZISF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1612. The applicant was notified by letter dated 14 November 2006 from the Court that this matter was listed today. The applicant did not appear at the hearing before Jessup J.
