I note that in the notice of appeal the two grounds raised both depend on the decision in SZBEL . The High Court observed that an applicant is entitled to assume that issues which a delegate considered critical are the relevant issues which arise when the decision comes under review. In relation to other matters there are comments and reasons given and conclusions reached in relation to the appellant's overall credibility which are adverse to the appellant. The Tribunal was not satisfied on the material. SZBGB v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 819 (14 May 2007)
