20 In NASF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 162 , the Full Court considered an appeal in circumstances in which a Response to Invitation form signed by the appellant's migration agent was returned to the Tribunal stating that the applicant did not wish to attend the hearing. Nicholls FM concluded that none of this evidence could demonstrate any error on the part of the Tribunal and accordingly its admission was refused as being not relevant under s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (' Evidence Act '). 2 The appellants are husband and wife.
