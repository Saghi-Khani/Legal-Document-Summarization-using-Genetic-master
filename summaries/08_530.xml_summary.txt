2 Ellendale Resources NL seeks an order under s 411(1) of the Act for the convening of meetings of its members and option holders for the purpose of considering the proposed scheme of arrangement. This provides a period reasonably required for the implementation of the proposed merger. 4 The position of ASIC is relevantly contained in a letter from it, dated 7 April 2008, to the solicitors for the applicant. ASIC advises that it does not currently propose to appear to make submissions or intervene to oppose the schemes at the first hearing.
