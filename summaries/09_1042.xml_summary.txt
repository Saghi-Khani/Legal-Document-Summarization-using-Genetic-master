The claims in the Federal Court proceeding, Mr Field said, are based on issues of fact and law about "which there can be no real dispute". Ground 15 alleges that the Federal Magistrate failed to properly take into account the delay in the Federal Court proceeding by reason of St George's notice of motion filed 17 April 2009 seeking orders that the statement of claim be struck out. Mr Field relies on events years later as matters disentitling St George from enforcing the guarantee and discharging Mr Field from any liability under it.
