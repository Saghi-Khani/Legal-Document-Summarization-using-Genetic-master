In order to obtain relief from these consequences, NuSep applies under s 1322(4)(d) of the Act for orders extending the periods of seven days and three months. 2 Due to a misunderstanding referred to below, the application for the admission of the securities to quotation was not made within the seven-day period. NuSep issued a prospectus for the issue of the shares and options on 14 December 2006 in which it stated that it would apply within seven days thereafter for such quotation. There followed communications between Mr Patel and the ASX officer assigned to the matter.
