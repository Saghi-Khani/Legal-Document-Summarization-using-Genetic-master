The Yawuru claimants opposed any such limitation and contended that that limitation would be inconsistent with their right to exclusive possession, which they claimed entitled the native title holders to determine the purposes for which the land and waters were to be used. ' 127 The extinguishment provided for in the NTA in respect of public works was confirmed by ss 6 and 12J of the State Validation Act . As against the State I have found that, subject to extinguishment, native title exists throughout the Yawuru claim area. Accordingly, the requisite occupancy has not been established. No such interests were disclosed.
