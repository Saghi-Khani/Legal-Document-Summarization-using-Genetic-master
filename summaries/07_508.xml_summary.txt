The money came in by electronic funds transfer of amounts not exceeding $100,000. 10 Before explaining the reasons for making the orders, I will make some preliminary observations. On 17 November 2006, on the ex parte application of ASIC, I made orders freezing the Australian bank accounts. Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Lee [2007] FCA 508 (11 April 2007) 6 ASIC is continuing its investigation into Mr Lee. In all more than $A7.5 million has been deposited. 7 The second defendant, Mr Jugraj, lives in Australia. Mr Lee maintains several accounts with ANZ and Westpac.
