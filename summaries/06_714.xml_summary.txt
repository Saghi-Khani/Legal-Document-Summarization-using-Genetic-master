I also take note of the undertakings to the Court given by counsel on behalf of two of the directors of the company to procure various payments to be made when St George Bank makes the funds available. The company was wound up on 5 May 2006 on the petition of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation following the service of a statutory notice of demand. The application has been brought promptly. The order was made in the absence of the defendant. There was no appearance for the company at the hearing, notwithstanding due service of process upon the company.
