The substance of the applicants' argument this morning before me is that to permit the present line of cross-examination being pursued before the Federal Magistrate would render the entire application before the Federal Magistrate nugatory. I will therefore, upon the undertakings to the Court that have been offered by Mr Dubler, refuse the application for leave to appeal. The applicants also seek orders before Lloyd-Jones FM that certain subpoenas be set aside and seek an inquiry into the conduct of the respondent, Mr Piscopo, who is the trustee in bankruptcy of Mr Hill.
