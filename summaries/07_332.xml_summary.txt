9 Because of its finding that the passport visa stamps had not been shown to be false, the Tribunal found that the applicant in fact had travelled to the Republic of Panama and the Maldives in early 2001. No declaration was provided. Importantly, however, no evidence was provided by her husband as requested. The Tribunal not unreasonably state that she and her husband could make any necessary inquiries. 4 On 6 January 2006 the Tribunal wrote two letters to the applicant seeking information and further evidence to support her claims. Only the appellant wife made substantive claims for the visa.
