The Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Act Amendment Bill 2006 provides an insight into the rationale behind the introduction of the new dismissal power:  Currently, while unregistered applications do not receive certain procedural benefits that attach to registered claims (such as the right to negotiate), unregistered applications may still proceed to determination. Pursuant to s 190F(6) of the NTA, the Court may consider any 'other reason' why an application should not be dismissed. No submissions were filed in response to his Honour's orders.
