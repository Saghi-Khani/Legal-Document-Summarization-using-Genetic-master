4 However, it was apparent that the appellant had obtained his visa to visit Australia in New Zealand, before he returned to India. 17 As I read the decision of the RRT, the material before it, while not sufficiently establishing the appellant's claims, in most cases did not positively contradict them either . No application for a protection visa was made in New Zealand. These assessments were all matters for the RRT and not for this Court or the Federal Magistrates Court. I find that the applicant has failed to establish any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.
