'  8 Section 8 of the Commonwealth Act provides:  ' A statutory declaration made under this Act must:   (a) be in the prescribed form; and    (b) be made before a prescribed person. 15 Regulation 1.21 is a definition for the purposes of Div 1.5 of the Regulations, which relates to domestic violence. Accordingly, s 27 does not apply to "statutory declaration" in Div 1.5 to include a State declaration. The appellant does not suggest any such contrary intention. If State declarations were intended to be included within the meaning of reg 1.21, such a reference would be expected.
