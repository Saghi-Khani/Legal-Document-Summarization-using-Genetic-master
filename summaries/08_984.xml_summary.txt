Nonetheless, in case I am wrong in that conclusion, I will proceed to consider the second step in Ebner. In my opinion, such a fair minded lay observer would not reasonably interpret my public comments in this way. Because the hearing of the substantive application was imminent, I made orders on 26 June 2008 dismissing this application on the understanding that I would publish detailed written reasons for my decision at a later date. It is hardly necessary to record the fact that since my appointment I have not expressed any views publicly, for or against, the Northern Territory Intervention.
