In general terms the appellant's claim was that the respondent received funding from the Commonwealth Government's Special Needs Subsidy Scheme (SNSS) which it was obliged to apply wholly or substantially to assist him to access education and services. At the conclusion of the evidence adduced by the appellant, the respondent made a no-case submission which the Magistrate upheld. If there were a failure to provide information to the father, that would not assist the appellant. Nor were they only emphatic ways of submitting that there was no evidence to support those particular allegations.
