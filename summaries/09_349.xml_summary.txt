Another matter to which Mr Cathro referred, and which is also covered by Mr Lombe's evidence, is that at the first meeting of creditors on 25 March 2009, the administrators informed the meeting that they would seek an extension of the convening period of four months, and they sought objections from creditors and noteholders present at the meeting. There have been a number of ASX press releases in relation to BBL and the issue of the unsecured notes. This application is made within the stipulated time. The repayment obligations of BBL to the noteholders are guaranteed by BBIPL.
