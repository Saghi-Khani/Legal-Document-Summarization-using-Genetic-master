Section 16(1) provides that, on an application for an order for review of a decision, the Court may make certain orders. The Protection Act requires the Minister to consider areas and objects of particular significance to Aboriginals in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. The Minister took account of evidence of a number of persons. CONCLUSION  Mr Dates has not established that the Court has the power to grant the injunctive order sought in the notice of motion. The section does not itself confer jurisdiction. IS THE RTA A NECESSARY OR PROPER PARTY TO THE PROCEEDINGS?
