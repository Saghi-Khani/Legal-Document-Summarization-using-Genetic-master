1 On 30 March 2006, I found that the respondent ('Siminton') had committed contempt by breaching and failing to comply with certain orders made by Sundberg J on 15 December 2006 ('the Sundberg J orders): see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton [2006] FCA 326 ('the first judgment'). The court may also suspend the fine on terms. 3 APRA submitted that the disposal contempts amounted to criminal contempt. 12 Siminton has provided no evidence about his financial circumstances. I would add that had there been any prior contempt convictions, the penalty would have been significantly greater.
