The plaintiffs failed in the MIS action: see Brookfield Multiplex Ltd v International Litigation Funding Partners Pte Ltd (No 3) (2009) 256 ALR 427. So far as an O 23 offer is concerned, I think it does give rise to a presumptive entitlement to indemnity costs: MGICA (1992) Pty Ltd at 240. There are cases, and this is one, where the stakes are so high that each party is willing to take their dispute to judgment whatever the cost. It is therefore necessary to determine whether the defendants' "walk away" offer was a genuine offer of compromise.
