2 In support of his application for Mr Pascoe's removal as trustee, Mr Boensch alleges a number of specific instances of misconduct or wrongful administration of his estate. Mr Pascoe, by his conduct of creditors' meetings on 16 November 2005 and 9 June 2006 did not deal even-handedly with creditors when assessing their entitlement to vote. The appeal was dismissed because Mr Boensch did not attend court. Ms McLean acted as both an undirected proxy for Mr Costin and as solicitor for Mr Pascoe. That was, first of all, a matter within Mr Pascoe's discretion as trustee.
