In the circumstances, it is appropriate that there be an order that the costs of the proceeding to date of the applicants/cross- respondents be paid forthwith. THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS  3 The applicants filed and served written submissions in accordance with these orders, in which they sought compensatory damages under s 115(2) , additional damages under s 115(4) , and conversion damages under s 116 of the Copyright Act . Furthermore, the respondents advanced an entirely unmeritorious innocent infringement defence. This was a critical finding on the copyright infringement cross-claim. So calculated, conversion damages may be awarded under s 116.
