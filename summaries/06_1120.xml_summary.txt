The Kimptons were 'attributable stakeholders' in KS and KPS for the purposes of s 52ZZR(1)(a) from 1 January 2002 until the companies were deregistered in April 2003. The Tribunal failed to have regard to decision-making principles which had been made by the Commission under s 52ZZQ and which were applicable to the exercise of the discretion under s 52ZZR(2) to treat the relevant assets as excluded assets. Assets so attributed could be taken into account in the means testing of service pensions. The value of the disposed income or assets will remain assessable for 5 years.
