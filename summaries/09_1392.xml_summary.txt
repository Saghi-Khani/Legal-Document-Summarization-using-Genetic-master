Ms Devers alleges that she was denied meaningful access to her employment as she could not comply with the requirements imposed. Focus's provision of services to persons with disabilities is irrelevant to the reasonableness of the requirement that Ms Devers attend training sessions without a qualified interpreter. Staff members without a hearing disability were able to comply with the requirement or condition that Auslan interpreters were not provided at staff meetings. CONCLUSION  Ms Devers has not succeeded in establishing any direct or indirect discrimination by Focus. At the time, Ms Dunn reported to Ms Foster. None is in evidence.
