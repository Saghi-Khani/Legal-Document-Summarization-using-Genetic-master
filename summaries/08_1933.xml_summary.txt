Mentha, in the matter of Hans Continental Smallgoods Pty Ltd (Administrators Appointed) [2008] FCA 1933 (16 December 2008) 30 I have already referred to the fact that extension is not for a fixed period, but is for a period of up to 90 days, and that Mr McMaster says if he is able to do so, he will convene the meeting of creditors at the earliest possible time. 6 The companies' creditors fall into three groups. His Honour in that case at [10] and [11] pointed to the complexity of the sale process as a matter which justified the extension.
