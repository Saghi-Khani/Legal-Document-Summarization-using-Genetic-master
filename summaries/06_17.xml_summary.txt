The corporate plaintiff has no standing to apply for Mr Cant's removal from Burns International so I suggested that Mr Cant might resign as liquidator of that company and Stafford Services, which claims to be a creditor of Burns International, could make application for the appointment of a new liquidator. As liquidator of one company he may wish to believe Cardamone. The trust assets were then surrendered to Greight. If the company is solvent the persons with a real interest are the contributories. The reason is that it no longer has possession of the trust fund.
