They may be summarised as follows: (a) The Federal Magistrate erred in failing to hold that s 347(1)(b)(i) and s 348(1) of the Act and reg 4.10(1)(a) of the Regulations were invalid, jointly and severally, by reason that they impermissibly infringed the implied constitutional right of freedom of communication on government or political matters. In my view, the observations of Mason CJ do not assist the appellant. In my view, therefore, little weight can be placed upon the fact that the appellant raised constitutional arguments. Those grounds of appeal are dismissed. (Footnote omitted.
