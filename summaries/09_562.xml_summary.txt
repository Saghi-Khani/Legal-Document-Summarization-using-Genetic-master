On 13 January 2006, Mr Davis made a belated attempt to overturn the Local Court orders. Section 30 of the Registration and Collection Act provides that, if a registrable maintenance liability is registered, first, the amounts payable "are debts due to the Commonwealth by the payer in accordance with the particulars of the liability entered in the Child Support Register" and, secondly, "the payee is not entitled to, and may not enforce payment of, amounts payable under the liability". The "Fourth Respondents" referred to in the amendments proposed by Mr Davis are the Estate's solicitors.
