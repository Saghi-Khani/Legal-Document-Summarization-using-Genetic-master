38 The appellant challenges those findings in this court on the footing that the Federal Magistrate erred by failing to find jurisdictional error. The Tribunal is not satisfied on the basis of his oral evidence alone that the applicant suffered any harm in or around October 2001 as an Awami League supporter or for any other reason. The appellant filed an application for review before the Tribunal. In it he says that his political affiliation with the Awami League and its leadership compelled him to leave Bangladesh. 21 I quote those matters because they go the affiliation certificate particularly.
