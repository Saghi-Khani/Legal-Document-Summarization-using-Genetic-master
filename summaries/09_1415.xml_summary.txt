(b) Whether all the debts relied upon by the plaintiffs were incurred by the Company during the "relevant period" that is between 31 December 2005 and 9 May 2006. Mr Carroll submitted that the fact that the Company was a fully operating, going concern until 10 May 2006 was a factor which had to be taken into account in considering whether there were reasonable grounds at any time during the relevant period for suspecting that the Company was insolvent. Mr Carroll was challenged on this answer. I reject that submission. Mr Carroll said that the Company was experiencing cashflow problems.
