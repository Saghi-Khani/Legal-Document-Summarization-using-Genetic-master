Paragraph 16A(a)(iv) particularises the basis upon which Dr Panaccio's state of mind is asserted in support of the attributed state of mind of Sirtex. The University now seeks to amend its particulars in relation to [16A] by including another director of the second respondent, the former Chairman of the Cancer Research Institute Inc, Mr Dane Gorn. Sirtex says that the application is late, is based substantially on material available to the University before Mr Gorn gave his evidence and is unfairly prejudicial.
