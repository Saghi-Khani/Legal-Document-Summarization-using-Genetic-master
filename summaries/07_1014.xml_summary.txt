A meeting was in fact held on 23 April 2007, at which a special resolution was passed that Hicom International be wound up under a members' voluntary liquidation. Thus, there was a failure to satisfy s 494(3)(b) , which required that the declaration be lodged with the Commission before the date on which the notices of meeting were sent. 11 Section 1322(4)(a) provides that the Court may make an order declaring that any act purporting to have been taken under the Corporations Act is not invalid by reason of any contravention of a provision of the Act.
