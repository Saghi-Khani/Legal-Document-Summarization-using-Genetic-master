Again, this is seemingly significant evidence in connection with the central allegation of JLV that Mr MacDonald breached s 182 of the Corporations Act and his fiduciary duties. 15 Additionally, the respondents contend that nothing in Mr Forgie's affidavit suggests any substantial controversial evidence from any witness located in Western Australia. JLV Industries Pty Ltd v MacDonald [2006] FCA 721 (9 June 2006) 11 There is no defence presently filed in respect of the amended statement of claim. 28 I accept therefore that there is a disparity in resources favouring the respondents. The factors are fairly evenly balanced.
