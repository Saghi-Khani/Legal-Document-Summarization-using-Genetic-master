I give leave to file the notice of motion. I also, yesterday, made an order restraining the first, second and third respondents from engaging in particular conduct identified by the order, until 4 pm on 1 April 2008. In addition, the affidavit deposes to facts concerning efforts made by Mr Grenfell, who went to premises at Shop 3, The Causeway, Melbourne, and asked to purchase a GHD hair styler. Ultimately, one was supplied. The search order made yesterday was directed to a search of premises at number 4 Parry Street, Moonee Ponds, in the State of Victoria.
