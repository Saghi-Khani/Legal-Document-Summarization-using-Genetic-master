10 According to QBE, Bayshore made demand on 12 July 2006 requiring that it pay the maximum amounts for which the First and Second Bonds provided. 15 On 20 October 2006 Mr Clavey of Clavey Legal wrote to the solicitors for QBE saying that its demand had been reported to Mr McMaster as one of the Court appointed receivers of Westpoint Realty and of Mr Carey's assets. He alleged that Westpoint Construction had defaulted under that contract. By that summons QBE claimed a sum of $3,562,656 from the two defendants. 22 Mr McMaster also swore an affidavit.
