Romer J decided this question adversely to the owner. Is the first respondent required pursuant to the Option to Purchase to provide to the applicant a contract for the sale and purchase of the property free of any other interests, including the New Gunabee Lease? The first respondent is the lessor and registered proprietor of the property. The lease contained rights of renewal and an option to purchase and the Memorandum of Extension of Lease, among other things, included another option to purchase. It also claims that the Gunabee Lease is a sham.
