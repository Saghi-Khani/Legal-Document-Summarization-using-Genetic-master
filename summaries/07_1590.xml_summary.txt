On the same day, 24 March 2003, Centrelink responded that if the claim settled for $85,000 an amount of $6,563.50 would be the relevant charge and the estimated preclusion period would run from 23 April 1997 to 18 August 1998. Those questions of law, as I apprehend them, are:   (i) did the Tribunal correctly apply the Social Security Act to the facts that the Tribunal found? The application for an extension of time is dismissed. (See section 1170(5)). Therefore as a matter of law, Ms Jeilles is subject to a preclusion period.
