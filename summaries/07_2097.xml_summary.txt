The Administrator gave undertakings to the Court that he would not sign any Deed of Company Arrangement prior to 5 pm on 23 November 2007.

It is by no means totally clear, therefore, that the creditors are better served by the proposed Deed of Company Arrangement. More specifically, the registrar had been asked to adjourn the hearing of the winding up application pursuant to s 440A(2) of the Act.
