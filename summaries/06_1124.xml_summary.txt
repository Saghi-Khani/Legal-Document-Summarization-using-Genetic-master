The applicant seeks a determination that no native title exists in relation to the land. Parcel 2 comprises proposed lots 1 to 7, Part Allotment 3 in Section 33, Town of Eden (Maling & Curalo Streets). A further reason why it is appropriate to make the orders is that the applicant brings the application on behalf of the local Land Council. The application is therefore unopposed; see ss 86G(1)(a) and 86G(2) of the Act. The only party which has sought to be joined is New South Wales Native Title Services Limited.
