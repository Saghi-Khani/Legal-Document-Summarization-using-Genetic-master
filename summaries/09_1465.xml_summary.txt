Auskay International Manufacturing & Trade Pty Ltd v Qantas Airways Limited (No 6) [2009] FCA 1465 (11 December 2009) A party commences a proceeding by filing an application in a particular registry of the Court. The Court must weigh those factors in each case. I cannot assume that, were the present proceeding to be transferred to the New South Wales District Registry, it would be ready for hearing consecutively with one or more of the other proceedings. For this reason the applicant seeks an order that, when transferred, the proceeding be placed in Jacobson J's docket.
