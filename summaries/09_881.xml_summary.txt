The Tribunal considered the appellant's evidence regarding his involvement with PA youth groups. GROUND 7  The Tribunal failed to make a finding regarding the injury the appellant suffered. This appeal is brought from that decision. His Honour correctly found that the Tribunal's finding was clearly open to it and did not disclose any jurisdictional error. In his 2006 statutory declaration, however, he claimed that his father had been murdered for his political beliefs. He submitted a letter from his grandmother to support this new claim. The second ground is not made out. He relied on his written submissions.
