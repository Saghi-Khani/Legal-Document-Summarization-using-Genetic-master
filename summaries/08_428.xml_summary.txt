Amendments to MBF's constitution made on 8 November 2007 expressly provide for the admission of a company as a Contributor Member where the company holds any membership on trust for one or more policyholders (rule 3.5A). The first condition relates to the provision of information. BUPA Australia Health Pty Ltd provides health insurance for over 1 million Australians.
