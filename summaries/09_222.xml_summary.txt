Uniline says the object of the invention is to provide for a bi-directional clutch that avoids the need for a plurality of helical springs (e.g., the need for multiple helically wound springs) by use of the single unitary spring as described in claims 1 to 12. Different ends are engaged depending upon the direction of rotation of the first shaft. Claim 1 of US Patent 643 is in these terms:  1. Both Dr Gilmore and Mr Hunter have provided an explanation of the operation of the spring clutch of claim 13. That evidence reveals this.
