This ground relates to the second Tribunal decision and not to the jurisdiction decision. Part 7 of the Migration Act, 1958 deals with review of protection visa decisions by the Tribunal. 39 I asked the applicant what he would have said to the third Tribunal had he been given the opportunity to address it on the question of jurisdiction. Justice Lander dismissed an appeal from that decision ( SZEYK v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 133). The applicant has been denied of procedural fairness. The applicant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the jurisdiction decision.
