There is one mortgage in the First Mortgage Portfolio and two mortgages in the High Yield Income Portfolio. The Upper Roma Street Property was security for the provision of a facility to Libbian. This depended on whether the FMIP had a beneficial interest in the second mortgage over the Boondall Facility prior to the Security Deed. Again, this statement suggests that the second mortgage over the Boondall Property was owned exclusively by the HYIP, as security for HYIP's loan of $1,550,000. This property has been sold. The letter "P" indicates that PA3017 refers to a HYIP account.
