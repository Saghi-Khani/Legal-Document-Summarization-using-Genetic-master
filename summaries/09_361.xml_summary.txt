Having considered the factors outlined in s 32AB(6) of the Act and O 82 r 4-8 of the Rules, I am of the view that this matter should be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. Order 9 r 1(3) provides that a corporation may not without the leave of the Court enter an appearance or defend any proceeding except by a solicitor. Having raised with the parties the question of transfer, neither objects. The discretion being reposed in the court it is inevitable that it be exercised in favour of a company where there is sufficient reason.
