The tender proposed that AAT would operate the Glebe Island Motor Vehicle Terminal as a multiple user facility. Therefore as at November 2002 in Port Jackson, having regard to the fact that Patrick and P&O were the only suppliers of automotive terminal services prior to the Arrangement, and the substantial barriers to entry, the Arrangement was likely to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition in the Sydney terminal services market. The proposed orders include pecuniary penalties to be imposed under s 76 of the Act. AAT now operates terminals in Melbourne, Brisbane and Port Kembla.
