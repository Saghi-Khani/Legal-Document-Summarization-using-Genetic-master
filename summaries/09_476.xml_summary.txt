Mr Atkinson deposes that he and Mr Di Petta have had discussions to the extent that there is value in the brand, WPS Motorsports. On 30 March 2009, a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation made application for the winding up of WPS Motorsport Pty Limited (Administrator Appointed) (hereafter WPS Motorsport). The relevant consideration under that subsection is, as the subsection states, is it in the interests of the company's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up? He, too, referred to Creevey's case, noting that it was the only intermediate appellant authority.
