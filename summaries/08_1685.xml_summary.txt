The effect of clause 44.2 is that the applicant can provide written notice to show cause in circumstances where the first respondent has committed a substantial breach of contract, for example where the first respondent has provided "a statutory declaration or documentary evidence which contains a statement that is untrue". The April 2008 report, together with the report of Mr Marais, sustain, in my opinion, the conclusion that the applicant has no reasonable prospects of successfully prosecuting its presently pleaded claim against the third respondent for damages. 5 SSM is not a party to the proceedings.
