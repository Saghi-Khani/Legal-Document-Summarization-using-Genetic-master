The time for return of an order is given the ex parte nature of the application made today, necessarily short. The applicant will not, without leave of the Court, use any information obtained as a result of this order for the purpose of any civil or criminal proceedings, either in or outside Australia, other than this proceeding. On 14 August 2009, I gave judgment in default in favour of the Australian Communication and Media Authority (the Authority) against, materially, the Fourth Respondent, Mr Simon Anthony Owen. In this instance, the application is one in respect of a costs order.
