The two scenarios are set out in Mr Chamberlain's affidavit as follows:   Scenario 1     If the DCT receives an advantage for its principal claim of $1,300,273.53, I expect the remaining creditors would receive a dividend of approximately 67 cents in the dollar. It included an unlimited indemnity by the DCT in respect of any costs order made against Mr Chamberlain. The application under s 564 of the Act Annexed to the Earlier Reasons was a summary of the receipts and payments of Mr Chamberlain as liquidator of the Company as at 15 June 2009. I agree.
