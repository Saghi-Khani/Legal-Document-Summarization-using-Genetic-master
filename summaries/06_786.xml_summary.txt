2 The only issue of substance that arose in the proceedings before the Federal Magistrate was whether the Tribunal was entitled to make a decision on the review on the papers without conducting a hearing. The appellant was not required to give sworn evidence before the Federal Magistrate. According to his Honour's reasons, the appellant had sought to explain that the form had been returned to the Tribunal by his migration agent without his knowledge. Unless that happens, it is difficult for this Court, on appeal, to consider in a structured way, further facts asserted by an appellant.
