43 The final step in the Tribunal's reasoning, namely whether there is permanent impairment from those conditions, is where the applicant's medical witnesses were not in accord. That application was formally supported by a letter from his solicitors of 17 September 2003 and by a report of Dr Cullum of 10 September 2003. Its terms suggest that the first decision purported to do more, namely finally to terminate any future entitlements under the SRC Act in respect of the accepted injury. He adduced evidence to the Tribunal of ongoing symptoms during 2003. The respondent accepts that.
