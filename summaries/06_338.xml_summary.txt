When the matter was before me on 15 February 2006, the parties had not reached final agreement as to the undertakings and/or conditions that should attend any grant of leave. 6 Upon these two undertakings being given to the Court, the parties submit that the Court should, by consent, make, inter alia , an order granting leave to the applicant, pursuant to s 237(2) of the Act , to proceed with the newly issued proceedings in the Supreme Court in the name, and on behalf, of Nine West Australia. The generally endorsed writ was subsequently issued.
