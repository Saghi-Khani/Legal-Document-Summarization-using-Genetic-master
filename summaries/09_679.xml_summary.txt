When the Federal Court makes a determination of native title in Aboriginal people, it does so in recognition of traditional laws, customs, rights and interests subsisting in those people as part of the common law of Australia. I am satisfied the proposed orders address each of the elements of s 225 of the Act. The name "Northern Kuuku Ya'u Kanthanampu Aboriginal Corporation" ("the Corporation") was chosen by the claim group. I am also satisfied that the parties have reached an informed agreement, with the assistance of independent experienced legal advisers.
