It gives liberty for a party, who claims to have suffered substantial injustice by reason of the orders, to apply to vary or discharge them within a limited period. I should mention the significance of the unsuccessful application to ASIC in case that causes any concern. It seems to me that would be going too far to directly involve such possible purchasers. It should also be noted that all relevant parties, save for any purchasers from placees, appear to me to have been served with notice of the proceeding, although not in a formal sense of being made parties.
