Before the Tribunal the appellant made no reference to Mr Meng. The Federal Magistrate summarised the grounds as follows:   1. The Tribunal failed to comply with its obligation pursuant to s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 ("the Act "). His Honour accepted that the Tribunal relied in part on the information that the appellant left China legally, that the information was provided in the protection visa application and that the appellant's reference in his review application to the statement in the protection visa application did not refer to that information. INTERPRETER : I think so. I would dismiss the appeal.
