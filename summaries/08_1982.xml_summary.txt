The Tribunal then said that, in the language of ss 120 and 120A of the Act, the kind of death met by the Veteran was death by pulmonary embolism . It may be that multiple medical conditions cause a particular death. Professor O'Rourke considered that the contribution of ischemic heart disease to the Veteran's death was negligible. That service constitutes eligible war service for the purposes of the Act. The material presented to the Tribunal on behalf of Mrs Collins sought to draw a connection between the Veteran's operational service and that ischemic heart disease.
