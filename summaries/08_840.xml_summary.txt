1 The applicant in this matter, represented in Court this morning by Mr Hardie of Queensland South Native Title Services has filed and served a notice of motion seeking the following orders:   1. I also endorse Mr Boge's submission that yet another expert report, even by a senior consultant anthropologist, would not endorse the native title application currently filed. The time for compliance with Order 2 of Collier J of 7 September 2007 be varied until 4.00 pm on 26 September 2008. At the very least it is possible that the proper claim group needs to be identified.
