32 The "new" allegations of fact in the proposed amended statement of claim could not support the conclusion that the respondent, in not being satisfied with the income tax return lodged by Haritopoulos for the year ended 30 June 2002 did not form that view in good faith. The "new issue" as described by counsel for the applicant, emerged in the proposed amended statement of claim which is annexed to the affidavit of Mr Charitopoulos of 29 May 2007. 2 The applicant has not paid either of the assessment or the penalty assessment. There is no reason to do so.
