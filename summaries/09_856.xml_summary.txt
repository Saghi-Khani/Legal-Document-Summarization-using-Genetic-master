Part 4.5 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act deals with "Court Proceedings on Claims". Because s 17(3)(a) uses words of wide meaning, all other forms of resolution fall within its ambit. Second, a claimant need not accept the assessment of the amount of damages. Accordingly, the Tribunal was satisfied that the claim was "settled" and the payment was made in settlement of the claim as referred to in s 17(3)(a) of the Social Security Act. This is an appeal from the decision of the Tribunal. First, an insurer does not have to admit liability.
