In respect of the first tranche documents: (a) ASIC does not object to inspection by the applicants of the documents numbered 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 13;  (b) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over part of the documents, being documents numbered 3, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 14. If ASIC wishes to claim public interest immunity over any document, ASIC must notify the Applicant and the Court by 4.00 p.m., 27 November 2008. The second step is to determine whether the documents tend to identify an informer or informers to ASIC.
