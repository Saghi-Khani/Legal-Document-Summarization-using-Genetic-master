(c) Based upon information provided by the State of Queensland, Ms Douglas says that John Wolff was also the registered lessee of Special Lease 43/31328 (Title Reference 17595222) over an area formerly described as Lot 5 on Crown Plan SH4. 16 Having regard to the material filed in support of the Application, I am satisfied that neither John Wolff nor Nancy Wolff enjoys interests for the purposes of s 84(9)(b) that may be affected by a determination in these proceedings. These former parcels are no longer subject to the claim made by the Kuuku Ya'u People.
