This applies to all Israeli citizens? THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE'S REASONS  The appeal before the Federal Magistrate concentrated on that particular passage. Those questions were not considered by the Tribunal. The Tribunal finds that in Israel the obligations to undertake military service generally amount to a non-discriminatory law of general application. However, in my view, there was also squarely raised on the material a claim that the appellant feared persecution by reason of being a conscientious objector to further compulsory military service. She responded by saying the government could not protect her from Palestinian or other terrorist acts.
