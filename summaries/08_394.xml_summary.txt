6 A further affidavit of Kylie Anne Thomson, sworn 18 March 2008, is also relied upon. In that affidavit Ms Elasmar deposes to facts concerning the supply by Mr Young of particular devices which were marked with the trademark but which were not genuine articles. Accordingly, I will make an order for a Search Order in the form of the draft Search Order initialled by me. The GHD products include a GHD styler, which is used for hair styling and hair straightening. 1 I have an application this afternoon before me by Jemella Australia Pty Ltd.
