It is perhaps unfortunate that the Tribunal only referred to the Applicant as being a member of a wider social group of Sikh landowners because indeed the Tribunal said at page 150:  The Tribunal has considered a particular social group of 'Sikh landowners'. The Tribunal also found that the appellant would be provided with State protection for any private harm that he feared. The third ground of appeal is not made out. That amendment fairly raised an issue which was before the Federal Magistrate. The Federal Magistrate therefore reasoned that the Tribunal assessed the appellant's claim.
