6 In the present case, the proposed settlement agreement is similar to that considered by Finkelstein J in Lopez, in that it provides for a process whereby the quantum of damages of group members' claims is to be assessed and determined by agreed counsel. Consequently, the applicant applied to the Court for approval of the proposed settlement agreement by notice of motion dated 28 March 2006. First, cl 1.1(g) of the proposed settlement agreement was amended to widen the Court's power to add or delete members from the final list of group members.
