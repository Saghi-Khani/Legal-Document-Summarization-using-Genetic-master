The appellant then sought judicial review. 11 Before the second Tribunal the appellant claimed that he had in fact been regularly practising Falun Gong in China since at least 2002. He said that he was a sales/department manager prior to coming to Australia, and had held that position from March 2003 to October 2004. Notwithstanding that response, the Tribunal concluded that the appellant's claims should be rejected. 21 The appeal raises one ground only. On 3 December 2004 he applied for a protection (class XA) visa. He claimed that the camera had been intercepted by the Chinese authorities.
