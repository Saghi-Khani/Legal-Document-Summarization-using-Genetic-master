5 In seeking leave to amend the statement of claim, Mr Perry in Court this morning submitted in summary: • The material proposed in pars (f) to (k) of the further amended statement of claim is not new to the respondents. Paragraph 17A describes matters which the applicants allege the first respondent failed to disclose to the first and second applicants prior to 19 February 2005. The respondents have a point when they submit that they have prepared their case on the pleadings before the Court. ORDER   1. Any want of clearness can be cured by amendment or particulars.
