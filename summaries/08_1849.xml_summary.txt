2 On 27 November 2008 I made an order approving the settlement and associated orders. 4 The affidavit evidence showed that inquiries made by officers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) (which represented the interests of Mr Stoyef and the group members) identified 116 clients of Masu. Discretion  17 The three remaining group members were: (a) Mr Stoyef; (b) Susan Windred; and (c) Messrs Speiser and Pather are as trustee for the Masu Trust. These are the reasons why I made those orders. The 49 group members who opted out were within the 83 clients who had settled.
