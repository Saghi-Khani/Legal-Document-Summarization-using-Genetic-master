The evidence shows that those persons who responded by sworn evidence when the application of third-party discovery was canvassed, deny that they screen print using the respondent's product. Both the original Notice of Motion and the application for leave to file an Amended Notice of Motion, are dismissed. They each said that the customer only uses the One Way Vision product for digital printing and not for screen-printing. Those parties have demonstrated that there is no proper basis for seeking third-party discovery. The affidavit of Ms Williams in particular is significantly deficient, even for interlocutory purposes.
