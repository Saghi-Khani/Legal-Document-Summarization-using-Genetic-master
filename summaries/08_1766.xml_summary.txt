That question is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the conduct of the Buskens in causing the second defendant to pay all of the legal expenses of the first, second, fourth and fifth defendants constitutes oppression. 24 Although reference has been made in the plaintiffs' submissions to the other grounds of complaint pleaded in the Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs have chosen not to support any of those allegations by evidence insofar as the present application is concerned. This document was filed on 28 October 2008. 36 In those circumstances, I am not prepared to grant the order sought.
