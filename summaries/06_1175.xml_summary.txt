Before the Tribunal, the applicant made five claims upon which he said he had a well founded fear of persecution for a convention reason. An unsuccessful protection visa applicant returning to Pakistan would not be vulnerable to persecution by reason of that status. The applicant then applied to this Court for leave to appeal from the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court on 4 July 2006. Leave is required because the judgment is interlocutory. The applicant must pay the first respondent's costs of the application. I have also considered the Tribunal's reasons for decision myself.
