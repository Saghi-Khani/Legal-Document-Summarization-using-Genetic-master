3 The respondents contend that s 83 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') is enlivened by the sealing of the judgment and that findings of fact by the Court are not confined to those matters proposed to be referred to in the orders and must include the findings in respect of the contraventions of the Act. Therefore the respondents ought not to bear the costs of the applicant's expert evidence. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Emerald Ocean Distributors Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 244 (17 March 2006) I consider these to be reasonable in the circumstances.
