3 Parts of the amended defences are said by the applicants to be deficient in various ways including failing to respond to particular allegations in the amended statement of claim and failing to provide particulars and matters of that kind. I will therefore order that the respondents' notice of motion dated 15 February 2008 be adjourned to 1 May 2008 and that the costs of today be reserved. The proposed amended cross-claim raises more complex issues. The first and second respondents also seek leave to file and serve an amended cross-claim in the proceeding.
