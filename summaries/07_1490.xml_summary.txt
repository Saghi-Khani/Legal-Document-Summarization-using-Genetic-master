Mr Sonoda gave evidence of the path taken by Brother Japan to convert a Brother DR-200 into an OEM product suitable for use by Company X. 58 Brother says that Dynamic Supplies' use of the Brother name on the Sample Units is a use in relation to goods in respect of which Brother's Australian trade marks are registered. Brother also submits that Dynamic Supplies has not established that the specific printer drum units the subject of the cross-claim were in fact defective. REASONING ON TRADE MARK INFRINGEMENT CLAIM  Did Dynamic Supplies use the 'BROTHER' trade mark?
