As noted in the submission for the defendants, no objection could be taken to a request for production of documents recording or evidencing the payment or receipt of the proceeds of the vessel, including any distribution of proceeds. Again, it is much too wide. PARAGRAPH 11  15 This seeks all contracts or other records concerning the management, ownership and possession of the ship "La Pampa" between the period 27 March 2001 and 1 May 2003. I therefore set aside this request as too broad. The plaintiffs say there may be a dispute as to the beneficial ownership of the vessel.
