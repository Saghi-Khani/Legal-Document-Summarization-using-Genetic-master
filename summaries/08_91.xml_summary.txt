22 This ground of review is based upon the decision of the High Court in SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152. It considered that even if the appellant suffered serious harm, there was no Convention nexus because the action was an opportunistic or criminal one by the local government and developers. 13 Fourth, the Tribunal considered that the appellant's failure to make these claims suggested that he did not have any ongoing interest in pursuing the compensation claim. Land's taken. Tribunal: OK. Appellant: An ordinary member. Two questions therefore arise.
