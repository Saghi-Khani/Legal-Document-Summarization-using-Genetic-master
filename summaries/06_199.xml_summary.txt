The question whether O 62 r 9(1)(c) should be invoked has arisen because the applicant pursued what purported to be "a constitutional argument". The respondents file and serve any affidavits concerning the issue of costs thrown away by reason of the applicant's constitutional challenge, on or before 17 February 2006. It is possible that because of its restrictive nature, costs orders against solicitors have tended to be dealt with in this Court pursuant to s 43 of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth). If a point is plainly unarguable, it is improper to argue it.
