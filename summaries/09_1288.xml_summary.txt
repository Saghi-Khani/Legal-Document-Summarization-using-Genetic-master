Also on 17 December 2007 the same delegate made a separate decision to refuse the application for the visa sought, namely the Class TH Educational (Temporary) subclass 442 (Occupational Trainee) visa. THE NON---REVIEWABILITY OF NOMINATION DECISIONS  The Migration Review Tribunal's inability to review the delegate's decision to refuse to approve the nomination in the present case is the consequence of such decisions neither being set forth in s 338 nor " prescribed " pursuant to s 338(9) at the relevant time. DECISION     The requirement of Regulation 442.223 has not been satisfied. The appeal is to be dismissed.
