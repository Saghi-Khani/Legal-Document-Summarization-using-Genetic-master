The serious injustice or prejudice that Mr Easton, on behalf of John Holland, says it will suffer arises from its desire to seek leave to appeal my decision of last Friday, 2 October 2009. For all these reasons, I refuse John Holland's application to vacate the dates set for the trial of this matter next week. Sometimes, even where it is successful on that point, it may not be entitled to costs because it fails on the primary issues in the case. I held the Union's right to raise that collateral challenge was not clearly untenable or unarguable.
