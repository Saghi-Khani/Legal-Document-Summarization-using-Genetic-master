The Tribunal is not satisfied that the applicant would make known his views about objection to military service when he was in Israel nor that he would refuse to serve if he returned to Israel. Section 421(2) empowers the Principal Member of the Tribunal to give a written direction about who is to constitute the Tribunal for the purpose of a particular review. There is no reason to read s 421(1) in a way that would stop the exercise of that power in the circumstances. That is not referred to by the Tribunal. It is a different one.
