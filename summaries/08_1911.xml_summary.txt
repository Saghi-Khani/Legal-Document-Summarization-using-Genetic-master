The mental injury issue  50 Mr Read argued, with particular reference to the passage in the Tribunal's reasons at [175] commencing "any continuing symptoms...", that the Tribunal only considered Mr Farnaby's symptoms at the time of the hearing and failed to consider his symptoms, and whether or not those symptoms indicated he suffered the mental injury PTSD, as at the time of his claim in January 2002. Medical evidence  41 Evidence was given by three consultant psychiatrists, Dr Ian Sale, Dr Ian Burges Watson and Professor Saxby Pridmore. In such a case there is no question of law.
