At [84]-[89] I gave consideration to whether, as at the date of the filing of Mr Pantzer's cross-claim, there was any amount to which Mr Pantzer was "lawfully entitled" from Dr Wenkart within the meaning of the consent order made by Beaumont J on 11 March 2002. 9 Dr Wenkart submitted that the conclusion in [32(e)] of my reasons for judgment of 11 April 2008 was not supported by any evidence before the Court and should be withdrawn. MR SHEAHAN: Yes. These cheques will be provided to you immediately before that creditors meeting.
