In Wilkshire v Registrar of Trade Marks [2009] FCA 1222 I ordered that the application made by Mr Wilkshire under s 88 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) be summarily dismissed under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The Council puts its claim for indemnity costs on two bases. This said, there is an understandable reluctance to make such orders unless clear and compelling reasons for doing so are present notwithstanding the litigant's lack of legal representation. Associate: Dated: 15 December 2009  Counsel for the Applicant: The Applicant appeared in person.
