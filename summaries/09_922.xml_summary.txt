On 6 May 2008, Heng V and Mr Lee filed in this Court a notice of appeal, purporting to be an appeal from the orders made on 1 April, 14 April and 15 April 2008. Following repeated failure by the appellants to comply with orders requiring them to make discovery of documents, the learned federal magistrate ordered that the appellants' defence be struck out. If [ Ms Wang ] or I refused to pay him $3,000 he would not permit inspection. The federal magistrate also asked why the appellants were not ready to proceed with the case on that day.
