On 5 March 2002, the appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of the delegate's decision. There is no justification for granting the appellant's application for an adjournment of this appeal so that he can present further evidence to this Court. When first asked about the documents that ostensibly supported his claim to have arranged for bribes to be paid through his lawyer, the appellant said that he could obtain those documents, and that they would "prove" his case. It is true that there was no interpreter at the first hearing on 10 October 2002.
