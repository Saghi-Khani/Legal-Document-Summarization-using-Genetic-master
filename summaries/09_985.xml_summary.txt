In this case I do not accept that there were special reasons within the meaning of O 52 r 15(2). Makucha v Fairbrook PMA Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 985 (3 September 2009) The applicant contends that his Honour erred in finding that interest on the judgment debt referable to the period during which the company was deregistered could be included in the amount stated in the bankruptcy notice. I am not satisfied that an appeal from his Honour's decision would have any realistic prospect of success. The date of the Federal Magistrate's judgment was 23 June 2009.
