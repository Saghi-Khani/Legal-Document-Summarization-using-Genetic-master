Ms Wu's solicitors then attempted to contact the respondents directly. 8 On 20 August 2003, the Court made an order for substituted service. The applicant, Jun Xue Wu, made this application by a notice of motion filed on 4 August 2004, which was part-heard on various dates until 27 April 2005. As noted above, Avin and Barry Armitage produced their list of documents only after Ms Krycer filed a second notice of motion seeking production. Also on 3 December 2004, Barry Armitage was granted leave to file a subpoena to be served on his former solicitor, Mr Guss.
