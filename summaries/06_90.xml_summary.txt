The Commissioner has filed a cross claim against the directors of the company but has been able to serve only the third cross respondent, Mr. Evans. In that case, His Honour acted on the admissions and made the order. He refers to authority that any payment by the Commissioner will be loss or damage within s 588FGA(2). There is no order as to costs between plaintiff and defendant. 15 In the circumstances of 6 February 2006 I refuse the application to amend and the application for adjournment. This was the first of three days set aside for the hearing.
