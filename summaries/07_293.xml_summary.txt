The applicant filed an affidavit in support of that application, contending that the applicant could not find the court on the hearing date on 23 October 2006. I make an order that leave to appeal from the decision of Scarlett FM should be refused. I say that the application is one, in effect, for leave to appeal because the appellants have filed on 18 December 2006, a notice of appeal from the orders and judgment of Federal Magistrate Scarlett. On 15 December 2005, the applicants filed an application for review before the Refugee Review Tribunal. 2) (2004) FCA 1275.
