THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT OF CLAIM  This proceeding, in amended form, is brought by the applicant as a representative party on behalf of group members who are commercial manufacturers of "Rubber Compounds" and "Rubber Products". The applicant has pleaded that there is a global market for the supply of rubber chemicals and an Australian market for those products. In paragraph 38 it is alleged that the respondents overcharged for rubber compounds. Counsel for the respondents submitted that the provision of some additional particulars cannot and has not remedied the deficiencies which were identified in my earlier reasons.
