The Applicant is the Trustee of the bankrupt estate of the First Respondent. Subsequently, there was correspondence between the Applicant and the Respondents in which the Applicant made plain its wish to have vacant possession of the property in order to sell it, as a result of the failure of the Second Respondent to carry forward her proposal to purchase the property. The evidence establishes that the two Respondents reside at the property, known as 3 Wallace Street, Delahey, and have done so for some time. The Applicant relies on ss 30 and 77 (1)(g) of the Act.
