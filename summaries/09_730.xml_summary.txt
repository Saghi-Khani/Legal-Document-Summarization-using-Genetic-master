It is unarguable that Ms Kingwongsa was not a permanent resident during any relevant period. By that decision, the Minister's delegate rejected an application by the second applicant, Ms Kathima Kingwongsa, for Australian citizenship by conferral. Section 21(2)(c) provides that the person must satisfy the residence requirement , under s 22, at the time the person made the application. In the first case, the prerequisite is that the person was in fact present in Australia. Section 22(5) is directed to the second element. Section 22(1)(c) is critical to the proceeding presently before the Court.
