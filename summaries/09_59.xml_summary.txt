As regards the nature and character of the mental ailment suffered by the applicant, the Tribunal finds, on the basis of the evidence of Dr Knight, that in or about June 2006 the applicant's existing mental condition substantially deteriorated to the extent that he then contracted a psychiatric disorder. The respondent, as Dr Knight stated in evidence, declined further follow-up with Dr Wu. Mr Lawson receives counselling with a clinical psychologist and is on an antidepressant medication (lexapro).
