" No reply was received from the appellant. A delegate of the first respondent refused his application on 24 August 2005. The grounds of appeal are therefore irrelevant to the Tribunal's decision. He claimed that the Tribunal failed to invite him to a hearing and therefore breached s 425(1) of the Act. 16 The notice of appeal raises two grounds not in issue before the Federal Magistrate. 10 On 9 December 2005 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant at the Kogarah Bay address advising that a decision had been made and would be handed down on 3 January 2006.
