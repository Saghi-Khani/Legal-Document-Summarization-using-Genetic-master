The share transfers involved Kendray separately transferring his interest in two lots of eight ordinary shares in the company held jointly with Hassall to H & K Earthmoving. Booth and Sanders through Territory Real Estate had marketing and sales skills. 171 For the reasons already given, consequently, I also reject the proposition put on behalf of the respondents that Territory Realty acquiesced in the running of Dundee Beach P/L by Garraway and others on behalf of shareholders which included Bishop Estate and Excess from 4 May 1999. It is not zoned that way. How would the proposed transferor express that?
