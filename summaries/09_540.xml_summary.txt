As a general proposition the paragraphs plead evidence rather than material facts. The statements by Mr Boettcher in his letter to DEWR of 23 November 2007, particularised in paragraph 78, acknowledged that:  (a) condition 3 of the approval required continuous operation; and (b) the respondent knew it had failed to operate the upstream fishway for long periods. In this case, the alleged contravention grounding injunctive relief was a contravention of s 18 of the Act. Wide Bay Conservation Council Inc v Burnett Water Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 540 (15 May 2009) Declaratory relief is also sought.
