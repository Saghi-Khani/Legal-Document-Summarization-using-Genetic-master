The overtime ban was encouraged and supported by Parker and Corbett on their understanding that Hooker Cockram had broken an agreement to engage an apprentice for the duration of the project. By organising the meeting of workers on 6 October 2005 and ensuring the continuation of the overtime ban until the Employment Requirements were met, Parker and Corbett clearly contravened s 43 of the BCII Act . Importantly, it is not limited to "building industrial action". The Court imposed a penalty of $35,000 against the CFMEU.
