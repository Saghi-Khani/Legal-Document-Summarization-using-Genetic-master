Section 424AA provides that the Tribunal 'may orally give to the applicant clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review' : see s 424AA(a). The appellants accordingly submit that 'express evidence' was required before Nicholls FM could characterise the appellants' father as their common law guardian. Such information was thereby excluded from the operation of s 424A(1) of the Act by s 424A(3)(b). Should the matter be referred to the Full Bench of the Full Federal Court?
