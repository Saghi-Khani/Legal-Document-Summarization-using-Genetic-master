Pursuant to s 40-65 a sale of real property is input taxed to the extent that the property is "residential premises to be used predominantly for residential accommodation (regardless of the term of occupation)". In reaching these conclusions the Full Court considered separately the meanings of "residence" and "residential". I have concluded in relation to the first supply that the apartments/rooms leased to MML by South Steyne are residential premises and are not commercial residential premises. The word "residential" was obviously meant to suggest something other than ordinary hotel accommodation. Is the second supply GST-free?
