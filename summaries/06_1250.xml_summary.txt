The question may be summarised as whether the purported question of law in par 2(g) of the proposed amended notice of appeal is a question of law for the purposes of s 44 Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (' AAT Act ') and O 53 r 3 Federal Court Rules . While the issues included in par 2(g) are clearly relevant, the paragraph is, as was submitted by Mr Coulsen for the respondent, a submission, a principle, rather than a question of law. THE COURT ORDERS THAT:   1. Commissioner of Taxation v Dixon [2006] FCA 1250 (18 September 2006)
