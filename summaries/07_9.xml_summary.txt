For that reason the Tribunal stated that it would deal with the application on the basis that the appellant claimed to fear persecution based on his religion. The Tribunal also accepted that he 'may have' been beaten as claimed. 29 Here, the questions of whether the appellant would continue his campaign of letter-writing in the future, and whether this conduct would lead to persecution elsewhere in Egypt, necessarily arose on the material before the Tribunal. In any event, the Tribunal was satisfied that the appellant could avoid these local problems by relocating within Egypt.
