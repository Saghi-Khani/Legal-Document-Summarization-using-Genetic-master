That is to say, the applicant alleges that by omitting to file substantial shareholder notices or by filing disclosures in which it was stated that Opes or the investors held the beneficial interest, the banks (and Opes) effectively disclaimed any beneficial interest in the shares and effectively declared, by implication, that they held the shares on trust for the investors. In the amended statement of claim, the applicant promises to provide further particulars of the banks' scienter after discovery. Whether this is so is something I will consider with respect to the causes of action pleaded against the banks.
