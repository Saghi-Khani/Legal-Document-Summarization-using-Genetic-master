Those principles are discussed in my earlier judgment: Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd v Football Federation Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 1134 at [2] . 8 As to the first argument, namely that any further order for costs would stultify the proceedings, I am satisfied that neither Cosdean nor its directors or shareholders or Mr Cosenza has the capacity to provide any further security for the costs of the proceeding. Cosdean contracted with Deumer to sell 500,000 key rings. 12 As noted, Cosdean's senior counsel accepted in submissions that Cosdean's claim at best, if it succeeded, about $3 million.
