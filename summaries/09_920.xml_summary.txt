Uniline asserts an entitlement to indemnity costs in respect of the cross-claims by SBriggs for infringement generally and specifically in reliance upon Order 23, rule 11(6) from the date of its offer. 706458 by Uniline Australia Ltd is dismissed. Accordingly, orders will be made in the above terms. Uniline says that it was wholly successful on its application for relief based on claims of unjustified threats of patent infringement proceedings. The offer was rejected. Uniline's amended further cross-claim asserting invalidity of the patent was dismissed. In this case however the offer did more than that.
