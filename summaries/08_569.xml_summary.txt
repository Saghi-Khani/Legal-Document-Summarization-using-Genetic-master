20 That section, in my opinion, provides power to the court to grant a restraint of the kind described in para 1 of the orders sought. 1 This proceeding was commenced by an application with which was filed a statement of claim in which it was alleged that the Respondent had infringed Australian Patent Number 697657 by the supply within Australia of a product which, when used by purchasers, was said to infringe that patent. That pleading also makes reference to integers of claim 1 and 8. It is brought pursuant to O 35A r 3(2)(c).
