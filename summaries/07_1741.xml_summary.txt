21 In relation to ground 2, I am satisfied that the Tribunal afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to respond to adverse material in keeping with its obligations to accord natural justice. Particulars      (a) The Tribunal Member failed to consider the Appellant's express claim that he was at risk of persecution because of his association with a particular social group, namely family, his race-Singhalese and been political party member of UNP. 13 Her Honour gave careful consideration to each of the appellant's grounds of review. 1 The appellant is a Sri Lankan national of Sinhalese ethnicity.
