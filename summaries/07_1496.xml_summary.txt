Introduction  1 On 6 June 2007, the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations issued a notice to Billabong Aboriginal Corporation under s 71 of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976 (Cth) ('the Act') calling upon Billabong to show cause by 22 June 2007 why an administrator should not be appointed. The Scolari Comerford report refers, in turn, to an earlier report into Billabong's affairs prepared by Ernst & Young. This is because Mr Armstrong has provided Billabong with all the documents on which he proposes to rely. (3) The authorised person may make copies, or take extracts from, any such documents.
