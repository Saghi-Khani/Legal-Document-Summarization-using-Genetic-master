12 The applicants are concerned that persons who see the outside of the respondents' store will mistake the store for a Clark Rubber store. By 17 January 2006 some signage in red and blue had been painted on the exterior of the building. 21 The respondents have used the colour scheme on their building in a similar way to the Clark Rubber colour scheme.
