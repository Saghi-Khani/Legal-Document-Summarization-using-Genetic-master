10 This morning Mr Philp for the applicant directed my attention to items 11, 12, 13 and 21 in the table in O 8 r 2 Federal Court Rules . The second respondent is a distributor within Australia for products manufactured by the first respondent. 16 In my view, the applicant has satisfied the requirements of O 8 r 3(2), and I order that the first respondent be served in relation to these proceedings. Proceeding based on a breach of a provision of an Act (wherever occurring) seeking relief in relation to damage suffered wholly or partly in Australia.
