Having found that the hypothesis of depression arising from severe seasickness was reasonable under the terms of clause 5(b) of the SoP, the Tribunal said:   The question [then] is whether the Tribunal can be satisfied that the seasickness was not attributable to operational service and whether the clinical [onset] of the depressive disorder was within two years of that stressor. The grounds of appeal related to the second amended question of law (namely pars 3 and 4 of the notice) are made out. Question (h) asks whether the appellant's diagnosed disorder "could be accepted" as war caused.
