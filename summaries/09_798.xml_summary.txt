It is true that the appellants have not prosecuted the appeals with alacrity. On 24 July 2009 I made orders dismissing appeals brought by Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd (in liquidation), Mr Peter Tracy and Sunstate Citrus Pty Ltd (subject to a deed of company arrangement). The Court informed the parties on about 26 May 2009 that the settling of the appeal book index was listed to 15 June 2009. I also ordered the appellants to pay the respondents' costs. I agree. The solicitor for the second and third appellants resisted this order. This judgment deals with that question.
