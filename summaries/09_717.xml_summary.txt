(3) Mr Klotz, in the supporting affidavit at [12], refers to the ACCC's estimate that the Cooling Off Witnesses will be required for cross-examination totalling about a week. Each of these three witnesses could be taken to documents occupying at least half of that Court Book and certain documents not in the Court Book. So understood, their evidence is, contrary to the submission of StoresOnline, centrally important to the outcome of the case. The motion must be dismissed with costs. (4) StoresOnline does not propose to adduce the evidence of the Cooling Off Witnesses for any other purpose.
