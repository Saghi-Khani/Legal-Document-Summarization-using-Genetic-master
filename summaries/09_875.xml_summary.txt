The respondent's interpretation of s 5(3) Section 3(1) of the DFRDB Act provides:  "service" means service as a member of the Defence Force. Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Authority v Gregory [2009] FCA 875 (18 August 2009) (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person has previously:  (a) made an election under that subsection; or  (b) made, under subsection (3), an election to become a member of the MSB scheme. The Tribunal's error does not have any consequence. However, the Court does not consider that the Tribunal was making a finding of fact.
