The respondents complained that the Amended Statement of Claim has assumed the existence of a licence, authority or consent from the third applicant to propagate 580 Rich Lady peach trees. 19 In my view, the particulars as pleaded are capable of supporting the allegations in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (e) of paragraph 34. However, the particularised facts lend no support to the allegation that the respondents commercialised material by offering or selling the relevant protected material to others: subparas (c) and (d). The other reasons concern the need to make a minor amendment to the current form of the Application.
