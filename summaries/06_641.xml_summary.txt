Counsel for the cross-claimant, Goldspar Australia Pty Limited (Goldspar) indicated opposition to making of any order pursuant to O 29. I mean you couldn't appeal against the order that the matter stand over. MR CONDON: Yes, I think that's probably right, your Honour. '  2 The matter was stood over to 24 May 2006. It would be unusual for the procedure to be adopted without the consent of both parties in a case such as this. That issue would have arisen if I had made dispositive orders or declarations. MR CONDON: I understand your Honour's reasons why.
