See generally my observations in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 at [49] --- [51]. During the period October 2007 to June 2008 (Relevant Period), Wilson had an insufficient number of patrol officers to make all of the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers. Wilson maintain and operate the Compliance Program for a period of three years from the date of this order. By issuing each of the Invoices, Wilson represented to each Customer that it had made the Contracted Calls in the preceding month, save for any Permitted Missed Calls (Call Representations).
