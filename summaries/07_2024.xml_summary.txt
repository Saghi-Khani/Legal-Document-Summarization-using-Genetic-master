Similarly, it is alleged that conduct engaged in by Mr George was in contemplation of actions of AAA Club members, without any material facts. It is then alleged that the internal operation of the APP Group gave rise to a relationship of agency such that APP Australia conducted the business of the APP Group on behalf of and with the authority of the tenth to twelfth respondents. 37 Mr George contends that the cases relied on by the Commission are not apposite. However, that paragraph has been amended in the pleading. 6 The pleading includes reference to other groups.
