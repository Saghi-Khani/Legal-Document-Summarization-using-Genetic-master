They submit that the only payment made by ABB Australia was the payment it made to the resident company, BAL, on 21 June 1996. The expressions "dividend", "paid" and "derived" are used in the withholding tax provisions now to be noted. Consideration  92 Section 128B(1)(a) of the Act tells us that the income to which it refers can be "derived" and that it consists of a dividend paid by an Australian resident company. Accordingly, s 19(4) had no application. Thus, ABB Australia derived dividend income from its subsidiaries, and ABB Zurich derived dividend income from ABB Australia.
