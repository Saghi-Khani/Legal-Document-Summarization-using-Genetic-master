See generally Soltanyzand v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1168 at [18] . The psychological reports were considered by the Federal Magistrate, who noted that the appellants do have significant concerns arising from the incidents of 9 November 2005. This has not been done. However, the appellant husband himself required an interpreter for the Tribunal hearing and before me. 17 His Honour found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the appeal.
