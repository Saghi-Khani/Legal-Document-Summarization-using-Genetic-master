Order 35A provides for judgments dismissing applications generally when an applicant is in default. 3 The applicants filed applications for leave to appeal in this Court against the decisions of the Federal Magistrates Court. So too, were applications for judicial review of the Tribunal's decisions in the Federal Court in 1999. They claimed not to have received the notices of the hearing date which had been sent by the Court. That hearing took place on Wednesday 17 May 2006. Those reasons were published subsequently. A copy of the amended application appears in the Appeal Book relating to the wife.
