The Company carries on business as a scaffolding contractor in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Queensland. 20 It seems to me that the shareholders/contributories and directors, namely Mr Milicevic and Mr Aleksic, made a fundamental mistake when they saw fit to put the Company into voluntary liquidation. In an affidavit sworn by Mr Aleksic on 21 September 2007 he deposed to the fact that the Company has 17 full-time employees and approximately 14 casual employees. 1 This is a most unusual application. I earlier referred to the resolution whereby they did so.
