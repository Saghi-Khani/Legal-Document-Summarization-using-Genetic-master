This was a proposition considered and rejected by the Federal Magistrates Court in July 2007, the Federal Court in December 2007, and in the special leave application to the High Court. In an affidavit also dated 28 November 2008 and a draft notice of appeal, the applicant proposed numerous grounds of appeal, including that the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal was vitiated by jurisdictional error because the Tribunal irrelevantly took into account the contents of the anonymous letter. For the reasons stated, I would dismiss the appeal. The first respondent filed written submissions, which were briefly augmented today.
