49 Mr Soars' conclusion is that each of the three impugned Austal hulls shapes incorporate integer 1.6 of claim 1 because they have a hull form in which the cross-sectional shapes throughout a substantial portion of the forward half have a bulbous underwater part and a narrow waisted part which extends through the water line. He also considers that each of the impugned Austal hulls has a width at the water line which is substantially constant, and therefore incorporates this feature. He describes the invention in loose terms as a 'semi-SWATH' hull design.
