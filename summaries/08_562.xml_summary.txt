16 Wainter alleges that the statements made by Mr Woolfe and/or Mr Malone during the course of their telephone conversation(s) with Mr Waller were representations to the effect that Wainter would be better off financially if it accepted the offer and further, or alternatively, if New Tel acquired the issued shares in C & T (s/c 30). 33 The pleading in paragraph 21 sets out matters of which Mr Woolfe was said to have been aware "As a result of undertaking or participating in the activities pleaded at paragraph 20 ... and other related work ...". It was later amended.
