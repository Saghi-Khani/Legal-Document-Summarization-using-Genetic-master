Although the application was filed before the expiration of the time fixed for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice, no affidavit satisfying the requirements of either para (b) of sub-rule 3.02(1) or sub-rule 3.02(2) was filed by Mr O'Meara before the expiration of that time. The application must be dismissed with costs. On 3 December 2009 I dismissed an application to set aside Bankruptcy Notice NN2140/2009 ('Bankruptcy Notice') issued by the Official Receiver on 26 May 2009, and served on the applicant debtor ('Mr O'Meara') on 5 August 2009.
