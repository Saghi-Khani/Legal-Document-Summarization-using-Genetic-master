It permits an inference only that a Tribunal leaflet is not on the Minister's file. The evidence includes the terms of the letter as recorded in [7] above. In his visa application form the appellant completed question 18 (his residential address in Australia). The Federal Magistrate held that markings on the envelope, together with Ms Carrillo's evidence, led to the inference that the notice was dispatched by 24 August 2004 and thus within the time required by s 494B(4)(a). Jones v Dunkel does not assist the appellant. That decision is distinguishable on the facts.
