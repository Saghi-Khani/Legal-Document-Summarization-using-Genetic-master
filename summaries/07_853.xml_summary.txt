Similarly, the direction to the second respondent to perform the work of a Leading Firefighter gave rise to a breach of cl 53.9.2 of the Certified Agreement. The second difficulty encountered by the applicant's case is that it depends entirely upon the acceptance of a particular meaning of the word "service" in cl 2.9 of the Award. Clause 2.9 of the Award does not contain in its terms any obligation upon the first respondent not to appoint any of its employees to a particular classification. This did not include the second respondent's previous employer.
