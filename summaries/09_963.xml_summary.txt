Of course in the present case, on the Minister's submission, s 494C(4) had fully operated on the first notification letter before the respondent notified her change of address. On 6 March 2009, the date of the Magistrate's decision, the Minister's solicitors advised him that the last day to file and serve a notice of appeal was 3 April 2009. Notification to the agent gave the appellant more time in which to lodge his application for review. Only one can be the correct approach. She is thus taken to have received the document at that time.
