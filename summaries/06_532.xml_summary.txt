31 Section 1218 of the Act provides:  '1) This section applies if, immediately before the period of absence commenced:      (a) the person was undertaking full-time study as part of a course of education at an educational institution; and      (b) the person was receiving youth allowance or austudy payment. That is to say, Mr Brown does not satisfy s 1218 because, during the hiatus period, Mr Brown was not enrolled at Sydney. The course at Birzeit was not an approved course of study or education for the purposes of s 541B(5) of the Act. That enrolment commenced in 2002.
