" Moore J observed that Cowdroy J had heard and dismissed a similar application in the matter of Croker v Commissioner of Taxation [2006] FCA 372. Mr Croker has come before the Court today seeking leave to appeal essentially referring to the following considerations. There does not seem to be any reference in the decision of Moore J to any application to amend the statement of claim. Mr Croker instituted proceedings in similar circumstances in 2006. Mr Croker says that because the Commissioner has not acted in accordance with the Legal Services Directions, there should be no order as to costs.
