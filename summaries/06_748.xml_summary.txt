THE APPLICANT'S INDEPENDENT SUBMISSION ON COSTS  167 Should the Court order that costs be paid by the applicant on a party/party basis, the applicant contends that the second respondent's conduct in relation to discovery also supports the Court making a discount to those costs. The overpaid rent was money had and received on the basis of compulsion or duress. There is an issue as to whether any such assessment can apply retrospectively. "  34 Clause 3.2.2 provides the second method of determining the rent. 46 Accordingly, leave to amend the first respondent's pleadings is refused.
