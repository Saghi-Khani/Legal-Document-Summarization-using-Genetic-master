As the primary judge noted (at [81]), the applicant's claim based on false imprisonment was made on three bases:  (1) The relevant provisions of the Migration Act did not confer any authority on a person, including a prison governor, requested by an officer to hold a detainee to do so nor did the NSW legislation. The respondent, the Commonwealth of Australia, seeks an order that the applicant provide security for costs in the sum of $50,000. This judgment concerns that issue. Any invalidity of the detention at Silverwater for want of procedural fairness did not last long.
