But, presumably as a result of the discussions, late on 8 August 2008 Freehills sent a facsimile to Maurice Blackburn advising that their clients would apply for a stay of the Vlachos action if the Kirby actions were expanded to include the Vlachos group members and the applications and statements of claim were amended to incorporate the allegations that were peculiar to the Vlachos action. A litigation committee could, for example, decide issues such as whether it is in the represented group's interest to open the class. I agree. Would separately represented plaintiffs be allowed to have two speeches?
