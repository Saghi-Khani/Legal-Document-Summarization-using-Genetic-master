The two circumstances relied on in support of the convictions were, first, that the form seeking the deregistration of the company, Aluform Express Pty Ltd ('Aluform') asserted that that company had no outstanding legal liabilities and, secondly, that that company was not a party to any legal proceedings. Whatever may be the true position under the Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW). The evidence of the applicant before me supplemented the circumstances. They appear to be otherwise well managed. Hopefully that situation will remedy itself in the period allowed in the proposed orders.
