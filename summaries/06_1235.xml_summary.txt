One of the claims made against Mr Dean Ireland was that he practiced a fraud upon Norilya. Acarus exercised its option to acquire the tenements under its agreement with the prospectors. On 10 June 2005 the Court of Criminal Appeal declared the restitution orders to be null and void and directed repayment by Norilya. A third phase of drilling was conducted by the prospectors in June 1990. The leave requirement is not expressly limited in time. Norilya commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia on 14 August 1990 against the prospectors. The bankrupt is not discharged from liability.
