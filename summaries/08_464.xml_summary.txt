2 The Award provides in cl 18.1.1 for a "general entitlement" to thirteen weeks of long service leave "on completing" fifteen years of continuous service and seven weeks of such leave "on completing" each period of eight years of continuous service after the first fifteen years. 1 Mr Robert Fitzgerald was employed by the appellant Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees Limited (TPT) for many years. TPT now appeals. Was he entitled to pro rata payment in lieu of long service leave for that three year period? TPT's construction would, his Honour thought, render cl 18.2.2 redundant.
