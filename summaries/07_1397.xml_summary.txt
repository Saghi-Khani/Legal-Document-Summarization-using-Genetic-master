On 9 November 2005 Ms Chaudhury implemented a decision made by Mr Maynard to issue an advice ('the DEWR Advice') to the heads of all Agencies concerning their obligations under the WR Act in respect of any industrial action taken in support of the Day of Protest. I further conclude that he was refused this approval because he proposed to use the leave to attend the Day of Protest. No evidence was led in explanation of the terms of Mr O'Sullivan's email of 14 November 2005 (see [55] above). Mr Simpson did not provide the requested advice.
