Those grounds of appeal identify no error which could enliven the appellate jurisdiction of the court. The first respondent asks that I make an order pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the appeal be dismissed for failure of the appellant to attend a hearing relating to the appeal. Such an order is within the power of a single judge. There has been no explanation given for the appellant's non appearance today.
