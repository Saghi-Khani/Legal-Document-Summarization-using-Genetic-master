ASIC's investigation has taken them to many overseas jurisdictions. 6 On the facts presently known to it, ASIC cannot show that Mr Lee is liable in debt or damages to any aggrieved person. He may not be the only "relevant person". On 11 April 2007 I made an order under s 1323(3) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) that, pending trial, the money in those accounts be frozen. Here we have a man who has millions of dollars in Australian bank accounts.
