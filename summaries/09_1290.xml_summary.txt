On 13 July 2006 the respondent made a decision that it was no longer liable to pay compensation to the applicant under s 29 for household cleaning services. She gave evidence in chief that the applicant would not be able to drive a motor vehicle when he was taking "this increased medication", Oxynorm. Counsel was asked by one of the Tribunal members whether it was his case that for the hours the applicant did not attend the rehabilitation program, he had a reasonable excuse. Evidence was also given by the applicant's rehabilitation doctor, Dr Brooke.
