The parties have agreed, and jointly submitted, that the appropriate pecuniary penalty to be imposed on the first respondent in respect of its contravention of s 18(3) of the EPBC Act, having regard to the facts and circumstances, is $110,000. If orders were sought against the second respondent, the maximum penalty would be $550,000. I am satisfied that the first respondent contravened s 18(3) of the EPBC Act by that conduct. However, it does not follow that the first respondent was unaware that the native vegetation and trees might be a significant wildlife habitat.
