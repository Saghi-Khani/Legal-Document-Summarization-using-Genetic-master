The State Act imposes a charge on employees in the industry to make provision for employees in the industry to enable them to receive long service leave benefits and, with the agreement of the employer, actual long service leave. Section 6 of the State Act provides:  (1) Every worker is entitled to long service leave, and to be paid benefits out of the fund, in respect of continuous service in the construction industry. The State law does not authorise anything forbidden by the industrial instruments. Part 6 of the rules deals with entitlements and payments.
