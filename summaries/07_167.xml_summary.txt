8 The second, third and fourth appellants made no separate claims and relied on those of the first appellant. There was no evidence to support the Refugee Review Tribunal's finding that:  i) the date of the applicant's involvement with the Jatiya Party was inconsistent with the independent information before the Tribunal. As the first respondent noted, the first and second appellants were given an opportunity to, and did, give evidence at the 3 December 2004 Tribunal hearing. The contested documents were not the subject of any ground for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court.
