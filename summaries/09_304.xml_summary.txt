The two Impugned Agreements that are guarantees by Mr Rose relate to obligations owed by Riva to Sakkara Properties and to RMB and Sakkara Capital respectively. Mr Rose had information available to him that would have enabled him to calculate the payout figures for all of the indebtedness of Moruben to the Lenders, other than the amount of the Net Project Profit. At no stage was any attempt made to tender any amount in order to secure discharge of the mortgages over the Moruben Road Property. The Quadwest Loan Agreement had expired on 30 September 2006. I accept that evidence.
