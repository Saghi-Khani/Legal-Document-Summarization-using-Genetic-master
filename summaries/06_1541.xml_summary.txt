The consequence is however that, as a matter of an ordinary Australian 'fair go' procedurally, this appellant appears not to have had one. However, the only information, broadly described by the Tribunal as 'sources', which found its way into evidence before the learned Federal Magistrate was a single article in an Indian newspaper. SZHMM v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1541 (13 November 2006) I suspect: probably not much different. His Honour dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') which was adverse to the appellant.
