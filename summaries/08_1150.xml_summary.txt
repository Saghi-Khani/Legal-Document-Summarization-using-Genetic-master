8 The solicitor for the respondents to the Amended Notice of Motion wrote informing the Court: Yes, the settlement negates the need for Justice Spender to decide the Notice of Motion. ... We do seek the restitution of the funds from the cattle sales and the Davis mortgage. 2 The Amended Notice of Motion also sought orders consequential on any finding of contempt. In those circumstances it is appropriate that the Court make no order as to costs. A hearing of the Amended Notice of Motion occurred on 2 April 2008. The proceeding is now considered settled amongst the parties.
