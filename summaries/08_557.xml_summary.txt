Section 272- 127 provides: (1) If:   (a) apart from this Subdivision, a trust is an unlisted widely held trust, an unlisted very widely held trust or a wholesale widely held trust; and  (b) each of one or more trusts of a higher level (see subsection (3)) has, directly or indirectly, fixed entitlements to all of the income and capital of the trust;   the trust is instead a trust of the same kind (see subsection (2)) as the trust of the highest level. The only requirement is that they be "of a higher level" than the status-seeking trust.
