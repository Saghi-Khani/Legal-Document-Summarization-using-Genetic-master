He refers to his participation in proceedings before Gray J (VID 335 of 2008 David Charles Barrow v Blackrock Investment Management Limited ) and Gordon J, Julie Anne Barrow Charitable Trust v BrisConnections Management Company Ltd [2009] FCA 412. The initiating process and the interlocutory process were filed by Mr Barrow. They do not demonstrate an ability similar to that possessed by a solicitor or counsel experienced in the practice of corporations law to make submissions in relation to the legal and factual issues relevant to an application to set aside a statutory demand. The applicant is impecunious.
