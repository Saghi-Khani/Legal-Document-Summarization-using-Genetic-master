GROUND OF APPEAL RELATING TO INFORMATION ON CD  First aspect: failure to consider relevant evidence   In oral argument the appellant's case was principally founded on the reasoning of the Full Court in X v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 56 ; (2002) 116 FCR 319. (f) The sixth sound file is another telephone interview between a representative of the US Copts Association and an Egyptian Coptic Christian concerning the alleged abduction of a Coptic Christian woman known as Ms Hannan. The Tribunal then turned to its findings and reasons. That remained the position before the Federal Magistrate.
