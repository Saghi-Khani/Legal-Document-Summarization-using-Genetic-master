(REVISED FROM TRANSCRIPT)  1 The Australian Financial Markets Association (AFMA) seeks leave to intervene in these proceedings under O 6, r 17 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth). Needless to say, ASIC and Citigroup, as well as other large investment banks, have a strong interest in these issues. In particular, AFMA would not advance any factual findings to be made by the Court. The basis upon which AFMA wishes to intervene is quite limited. 10 Mr Stevenson SC, for ASIC, opposes intervention. The parties are very well represented by substantial teams of counsel and solicitors.
