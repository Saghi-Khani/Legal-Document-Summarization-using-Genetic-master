As the primary judge observed, any assessment of the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution would be affected by evidence about the appellant husband having continued to live in his home in Hyderabad. Hence, evidence given by one applicant relevant to another applicant is not within the exception in s 424A(3)(b) ( SZGSI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 160 FCR 506 ; [2007] FCAFC 110). 14 The Tribunal took evidence from the appellant wife. The Tribunal said this claim "lacked details". The applicant husband said it happened in January 2005. Section 424A is a mandatory provision.
