The President's letter concluded by informing the solicitors that an application could be made to this Court within 28 days of the issue of the notice of termination. There was no claim made (as referred to in s 33C(1)(c)) by the group members in any of those documents for an allowance of further time to file an application under s 46PO(2) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act . The State of Queensland was the first respondent. I am not satisfied that Mr Wotton acted unreasonably in bringing these proceedings in his own right.
