Accordingly, on the one hand, at material times following the execution of the GSA, the applicants appear to have held the belief that, under the GSA, Barton International had assumed the obligation to brand, as GMA garnet, all GMA garnet supplied under the GSA and to promote, and not to diminish, distribution of discounted Product in North America. Mr Cole did not propose any further amendment to cl 4.2 of the draft GSA. Barton International was prepared to "so undertake". Mr Ketelsen also knew that BMC sold garnet to third party customers in the USA.
