Yours sincerely   Kevin Stokes  Group General Manger  Fairfax Enterprises  The warning letter was given to the applicant after the decision was made to terminate his employment. The evidence of both Ms Fernandes and Ms Carrington was that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the applicant's work performance and behaviour. The words of the s 824(1) of the WR Act require me to consider whether the proceeding was instituted vexatiously or without reasonable cause. It's your sale. Mr Dowling: Well no one has said anything to me. Paul Kent - FIS Team Sales Manager  1.
