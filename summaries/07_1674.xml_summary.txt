Section 70(5)(d) of the Act is relevant if aggravation of Mr Robertson's PTSD is claimed. TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS  14 There was no dispute before the Tribunal that Mr Robertson suffers from PTSD, alcohol dependence and major depression. Section 9(1) is irrelevant to Mr Robertson whose entitlement to a pension will be based upon his 'defence service', and not 'eligible war service' as considered by the Tribunal. In any event, the SoP operates, by factor 5(a) to establish a connection to service (experiencing a severe stressor prior to the clinical onset of post traumatic stress disorder).
