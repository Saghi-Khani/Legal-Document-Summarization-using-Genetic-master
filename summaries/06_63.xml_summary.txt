12 There is no definition of the expression 'penalties' in s 82(3). ...   82(3A) An amount payable under an order made under a proceeds of crime law is not provable in bankruptcy. Consequently, neither the fines imposed, nor the costs ordered to be paid, were provable in the bankruptcy. The Court concluded that there was no power under the Bankruptcy Act 1924-1960 (Cth) to discharge the order upon which the bankrupt had been imprisoned. Section 60(1)(b) is available only if the process to be stayed is in respect of the non-payment of a provable debt.
