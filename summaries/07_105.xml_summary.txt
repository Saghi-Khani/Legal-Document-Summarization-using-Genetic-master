Counsel for the Minister filed in Court a short affidavit from a solicitor who had acted for the Minister when the proceeding was before the Federal Magistrates' Court. 6 On 13 September 2006 a Federal Magistrate made orders that the application be dismissed with costs. 15 It is now clear, in my view, that the learned Federal Magistrate dismissed the applicant's application for judicial review of the delegate's decision on a final basis. None of these grounds was particularised. 14 The applicant attended the adjourned hearing on 16 February 2007. 2 The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision.
