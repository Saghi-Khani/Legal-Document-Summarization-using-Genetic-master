The appellants' submissions stressed the irrelevancy of the ethnicity of the appellants as a factor in the determination by the Tribunal as to whether the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of their membership of their particular social group, which was wealthy, middle class businessmen. The Tribunal finds this to be the case in spite of his past associations with Tamil people and military officers. The Tribunal also found to be remote the chance that the appellants would suffer abduction or other serious harm for reason of being a member of their particular social group.
