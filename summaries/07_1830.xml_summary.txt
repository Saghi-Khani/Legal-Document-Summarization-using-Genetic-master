The liquidator said he took no step to find a tenant because he believed that Mr Tayles would soon make an application to the court to regain control of the properties. Only at that point could the liquidator consider a transfer of the properties. On 28 February 2005 the appointor removed Taycorp as trustee of the discretionary trust and replaced it with Miller Street Pty Ltd, the plaintiff. The reason was that the CBA had not finalised the restructure of the loans. 17 The guarantee for $225,000 was provided on 12 January 2006. Only two creditors lodged proofs.
