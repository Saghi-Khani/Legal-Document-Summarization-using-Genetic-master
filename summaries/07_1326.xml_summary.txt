13 Even if there were power to set aside the orders of 9 February 2007, I would not do so. The respondents had filed an application for security of costs. The Court in Yevad [2005] FCAFC 263 ; 147 FCR 282 had to consider a case where the notice of motion for reopening of an appeal where final orders had been made was filed before the orders were entered. If the Court is exercising the appellate or related jurisdiction under Div 2 of Pt III of the Act, subrule (2) does not apply. The "appeal" was the exercise of original jurisdiction.
