5 On 25 June 2008, that is less than a week after costs orders were made, Messrs Hosking and D'Antonio, who are the sole directors and shareholders of GMCA, registered a fixed and floating charge dated 23 June 2008 in their favour from GMCA. 6 On 30 September GMCA's solicitors, Kahns Lawyers, filed a notice of ceasing to act. 1 The applicants (collectively, Black & Decker) apply for an order under O 62, r 4(2)(c) and (d) of the Federal Court Rules for a gross sum assessment of their costs. The costs could be quite substantial.
