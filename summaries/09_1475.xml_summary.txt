However, while the rules of evidence may not apply, the Tribunal is specifically enjoined to ensure that every party to a proceeding before it "is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case"; s 39(1). The Tribunal was also not satisfied that in the 5 year period before he made his application, Mr Mautner was engaged in activity beneficial to Australia. Mautner v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2009] FCA 1475 (11 December 2009) The application must be dismissed with costs. The Tribunal considered Mr Mautner's evidence concerning his activities overseas.
