2 The Creditor was an assignee of debt from a firm of solicitors called Lennon Settle Mazzeo Lawyers (the Assignor). 1 The appellant Tony Cavoli (the Creditor) appeals against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court which set aside a bankruptcy notice served on the respondent Karl Etl (the Debtor): Etl v Cavoli [2007] FMCA 356. Would it be a proper purpose if your sole purpose for filing a bankruptcy notice was to put pressure on the individual to pay the debt? The notice of assignment dated 1 May 2006 was in evidence, although not the assignment itself.
