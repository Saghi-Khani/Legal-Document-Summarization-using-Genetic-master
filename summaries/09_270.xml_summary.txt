This possibility was found by the Tribunal to be sufficient to find that the hypothesis connecting service to the veteran's death was reasonable in assessing the claim under s 120(3) of the VE Act:  In our view the material before us points relevantly to one cause of Dr Walker's death being IHD. The IHD SoP had been made, and it was directly relevant to the respondent's claim which contended that the veteran's 'kind of death' (heart failure) was caused by IHD. The application for a costs certificate is opposed by the Commission.
