The child care business purchased by the applicant is conducted at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup. 19 Approximately two weeks prior to settlement in a telephone conversation with Ms Skinner, Ms Dornford advised her that the first and second respondents would be taking the telephone number 9244 1905 to the premises of Karrinyup Child Care Centre at 22 Davenport Street. That latter name is identified as 'the Business Name'. There are other claims for breaches of contract not presently relevant. In contrast the 2006 Yellow Pages advertisement shows, as has been said, the two telephone numbers including the number in dispute.
