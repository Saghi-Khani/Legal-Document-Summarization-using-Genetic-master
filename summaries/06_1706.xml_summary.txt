The Tribunal stated that the appellant had given a number of reasons why she considered that she had a well-founded fear of persecution from the Chinese authorities upon the ground of her imputed involvement in Falun Gong. SZIWJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1706 (27 November 2006) 37 I reject the submission put by counsel for the appellant that the Tribunal failed to address a contention. In my view that is apt in the present case. The initial claim for protection was made in 2001 and was rejected by a delegate of the Minister.
