The ordinary reasonable consumer looking at the "Corn Thins" sour cream and chives package would know that they were not SunRice's product, or associated at all with the SunRice product that was marketed as its sour cream and chives rice cake. After Ms Anderson did the packaging and market research, she decided on the colours and designs for the packaging of Real Foods' three flavoured corn thins. She would realise that those two were different. Here, Real Foods adopted colours and printed flow pack packaging which were in common use in the savoury biscuits category. I accept that evidence.
