See for example Stedman v Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 539 which referred in turn to Evans v Heather Thiedeke Group Pty Ltd (1990) 95 ALR 424. Because the original order was made in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, it is apparently thought desirable that any application pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act be made to that Court. Thus, the practical effect of the sequestration order would not lead to any moneys held pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Act being vested in the Trustee to the exclusion of the bankrupt if released after the stay.
