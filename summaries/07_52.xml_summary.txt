57 I will make a declaration that the University breached cl 6 of Sch D of the 2004 certified agreement by failing to provide adequate particulars of the allegations made against the applicant. Further, the University, as part of the process, through the Vice Chancellor's letter of 6 January 2006, in fact, administered 'disciplinary action' by suspending the applicant without pay, in reliance upon the commencement of the process. 3 In early February 2006, the University advised the applicant that it had established a Misconduct Investigation Committee ('the Committee') to investigate the allegations. Each of the parties read affidavits.
