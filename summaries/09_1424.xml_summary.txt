I would follow the decisions in Australian Gas Light , Symbion and Anzon Energy . Emmett J relied upon CMPS&F to make orders terminating the holding of meetings which had not yet been held in order to consider resolutions for the approval of schemes. On 22 October 2009, White Energy despatched the scheme booklet. Those concessions, said Mr Atkinson, were not able to be made. As a consequence, said Mr Atkinson, an agreement has been entered into between ASSAC and White Energy terminating the merger implementation agreement and releasing each other from any obligations and liabilities arising under that agreement.
