1 This is an application for an extension of time in which to file and serve a notice of appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court delivered on 13 June 2006 ( SZHKU & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs & Anor [2006] FMCA 842). The oral submissions were really an appeal to the merits of the case and also endeavoured to draw attention to the current situation in Fiji which would, of course, only be relevant if there were any appealable ground to set aside the earlier decisions. The second applicant is to pay the costs of the respondent.
