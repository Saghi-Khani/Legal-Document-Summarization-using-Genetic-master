...  During the interlocutory process before the AAT, Deputy President Hotop stated to me in court that he was only interested in evidence for the relevant period of December 99 to January 2000, in order to determine the question at issue as to whether or not Samantha and I were in a marriage like relationship at that time. The SSAT, on 31 May 2007, also affirmed the decisions and on 26 June 2007, Mr Fazio filed an application with the AAT for a review of Centrelink's decisions on behalf of Ms Underdown. The appeal must be dismissed.
