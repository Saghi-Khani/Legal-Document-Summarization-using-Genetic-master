In respect of the fifth and sixth ACF Notices, I consider that there is nevertheless a significant class of recipients --- whether first-time recipients or perhaps having received one or two or more of such notices before --- who would address that notice with low involvement. Since 2003, Adelaide City Fines Pty Ltd (ACF) has been the monitor of Park Fast car parks. The Council employs "authorised persons" known as parking inspectors to monitor car parks in open car parks and to issue Expiation Notices. She says they are clearly "fine tickets".
