I have also taken into account that at present there is no substantive evidence to indicate what the outcome would be for Cosdean if it were to succeed in this action. In any event, that sum advanced during the course of the last financial year now represents a significant liability of Cosdean. I propose to make an order that Cosdean provide to FFA security for costs in the sum of $40,000. Cosdean is a small one-shareholder company. Its balance sheet at 30 June 2006 is not presently available. In my view the threshold test has been satisfied.
