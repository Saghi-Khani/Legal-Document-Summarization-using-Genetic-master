However, I think that I ought to find that the charge number 2 has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt because of the difference in interpretation which order 1 made by Wilcox J could give rise to having regard to the heads of agreement. The applicant urged that findings I had made in Natural Floor Covering Centre Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 3) [2006] FCA 602 at [12] in any event precluded the respondent having success on the reopening. That is so even though this is not necessarily the only construction that one would make.
