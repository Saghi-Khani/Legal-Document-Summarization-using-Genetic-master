The Full Court said, in M18/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 127 , at [10]-[11], as follows:  "In a notice of appeal filed on 1 December 2003, the appellant effectively repeated the ground raised before the primary judge. Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellants again argued that the RRT had erred by considering out-of-date country information and that there had been a denial of procedural fairness because the first appellant was medically unfit to attend the hearing before the RRT. " 8 The Full Court dismissed the appeal on 14 May 2004.
