No defences or cross-claims have been filed in the Thompson proceedings as a result of the notice of motion for consolidation being raised at the first directions hearing for that matter. Mr Jensen opposed the making of these orders whereas Mr Thompson was content to submit to any order of the Court. The respondents in the Jensen proceedings claim that the termination was lawful by reason of Mr Jensen having engaged in serious misconduct. 2 The Jensen proceedings involve a claim by Mr Jensen against HFA Holdings Limited and HFA Admin Pty Ltd for breach of an employment contract.
