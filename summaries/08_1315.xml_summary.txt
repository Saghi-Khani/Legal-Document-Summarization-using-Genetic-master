The first respondent pay the second respondent's costs of its cross-claim against him. For those reasons I am not prepared to either make the declarations which are sought or to make rulings as to heads of loss and will adjourn the matter or assessment of damages by another judge in due course. I found for Sirtex on the cross-claim and made the following orders:    9. 4 The test, as I think counsel for Sirtex Mr Elliott accepted, must always remain one of causal connection in terms of s 79 of the Fair Trading Act .
