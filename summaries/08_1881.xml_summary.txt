3 The applicant filed the application for an extension of time on 6 November 2008. The solicitors charged money and the applicant could not afford the Court fees. The draft notice of appeal, in substance, repeats the same grounds as considered by the primary judge. However, under order 52 rule 15(2) the Court for special reasons may at any time give leave to file and serve a notice of appeal. The merits of the substantial application are weak. As such that new information cannot found any jurisdictional error in respect of the decision which is currently before the Court.
