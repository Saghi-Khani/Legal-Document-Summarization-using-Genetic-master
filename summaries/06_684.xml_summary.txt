The Court could, as an incident of its power to appoint receivers, require a relevant person to present himself or herself for examination by the receivers or ASIC before a Registrar in order to ascertain the extent and nature of the person's assets. The letter was dated 12 May 2006 and set out a living expenses request on behalf of Mr Carey. Nor did he make any reference to their assets and liabilities. 5 Each of the defendants has prepared and delivered affidavits of their assets and liabilities pursuant to the order which I made on 20 April 2006.
