His Honour was satisfied that the Federal Magistrates Court had no jurisdiction to hear the application because s 477(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) requires an application to the court to be made within 28 days of the actual notification of a decision of the Tribunal. I would therefore make the following orders:  (1) Leave to appeal against the decision of Scarlett FM of 18 June 2007 be granted. 12 In his reasons for judgment Scarlett FM drew attention to the delays in this matter.
