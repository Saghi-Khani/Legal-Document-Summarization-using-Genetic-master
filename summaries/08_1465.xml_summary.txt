The Court finds that the Technicon drawing substantially reproduces the Caroma drawing: see s 14 of the Copyright Act . Was the infringement innocent? CONCLUSION   Technicon has infringed Caroma's registered design No. Mr Granger considered other visual differences between the registered design and the Technicon pan. Mr Granger further said that the Technicon drawing depicts the Trident pan, not the Technicon pan. In these circumstances the Court does not consider that Technicon's infringement was flagrant. In cross examination Mr McCallum acknowledged that in 1990 he had been aware that the designs of products could be protected by registration.
