By decision dated 18 th March 2009 the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the SSAT (the suspension of the Applicant's Carer Payment), and directed that the decision to raise and recover debt against the Applicant be referred back to the Respondent for reconsideration in light of the further information provided at the hearing. As noted in the factual outline, Mr Cosenza received notices requesting information on 7 January 2008 and 30 April 2008. All such payments were made under, and in accordance with, provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). This matter has had a tortured history.
