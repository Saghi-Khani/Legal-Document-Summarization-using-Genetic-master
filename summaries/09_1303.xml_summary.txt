The respondent submitted that there was no proper basis for the appellant's submission that the Federal Magistrate had failed to afford the appellant procedural fairness, given that the Federal Magistrate had listened to the audio tape of the Tribunal hearing and read the transcript prepared by the appellant's representative. The Tribunal gave its reasons for these findings, namely that "important aspects of the Applicant's claims and evidence were not credible". The Tribunal considered that the letters he presented from clerical persons in Nigeria and Australia supporting his claims were outweighed as evidence by these serious flaws.
