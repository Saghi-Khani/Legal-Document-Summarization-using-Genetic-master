That section relevantly provides: Tribunal must invite applicant to appear   (1) The Tribunal must invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. See also my reasons in SZGGD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 1250 at [21] --- [38]. The Federal Magistrate dismissed the appellants' application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (Tribunal) given 20 April 2009. For these reasons, this ground must fail. The Act permits the Tribunal's hearings to be conducted remotely.
