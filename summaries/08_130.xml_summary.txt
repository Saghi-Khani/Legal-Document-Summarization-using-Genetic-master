18 I propose to allow 28 rather than 7 days from the date of service of this judgment and orders for compliance by Mr Mansfield with the order. The Court had given judgment on 21 February 2003. 5 ACMA's motion seeking a time limit by which payment of pecuniary penalties must be made was filed on 7 June 2007. An order was made requiring the payment of a fine. The application of the slip rule has the effect of amending the original orders. The parties acknowledged that costs would follow the event.
