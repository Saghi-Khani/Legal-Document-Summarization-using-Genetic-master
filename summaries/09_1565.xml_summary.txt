The ACMA alleges, and Mr Atkinson admits, that by engaging in the conduct pleaded in the statement of claim, between approximately 25 October 2006 and 17 December 2007, he caused to be sent unsolicited commercial electronic messages, which had an Australian link, in contravention of s.16(1) of the Spam Act . A spam email sent by a Sancash affiliate would contain an internet link through which the recipient of the spam email could order a promoted product. Similar views were expressed in relation to the pecuniary penalty sought against the individual, Mr Mansfield. 08CV5666. 08CV5666. The proceedings were contested.
