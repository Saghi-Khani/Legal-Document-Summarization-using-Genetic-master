The delay in this case was significantly less than that considered in Nais (41/2 years) where the High Court did find a breach of procedural fairness. The regulations provide as follows (emphasis added):  "801.22 Criteria to be satisfied at the time of the decision   801.221   (1) The applicant meets the requirements of subclause (2), (2A), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (8). On 12 July 2001, the appellant married an Australian citizen, Karishma Kumari. On 19 October 2004 a delegate of the Minister refused to grant Mr Hassan a permanent visa. The appellant now appeals from that decision.
