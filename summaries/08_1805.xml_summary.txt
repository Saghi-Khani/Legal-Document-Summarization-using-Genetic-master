The offer also provided a time for acceptance in accordance with O 23 r 5(3). The applicants summarily rejected the two settlement offers made by Redberry. For the reasons stated, I would order that: (1) the applicants pay the respondent's costs of the application; and (2) the cross-claimant pay the cross-respondents' costs of the cross-claim. 28 Redberry relied on the fact that Review Australia was not joined as a party to the proceeding until 10 August 2007. It was not unreasonable. This was Redberry's first settlement offer. The applicants' claim was tenable.
