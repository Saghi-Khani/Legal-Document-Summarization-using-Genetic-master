CONCLUSION  45 For the reasons stated above and those delivered on 2 November 2007 following the first court hearing, I made the orders approving the Scheme on 10 December 2007. Mr Seckold states that he took the view that without the provision for the Coeur break fee, the Coeur shareholders would have "a free option over the scheme". However, solicitors for Bolnisi informed the Court that Bolnisi's New Zealand counsel advised that the Takeovers Panel in New Zealand had not had to consider the issue of naked no vote break fees, or break fees more generally.
