The application before the Federal Magistrate sought judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") of 5 November 2004, handed down on 2 December 2004. 7 The application for an extension of time to appeal was filed in this Court on 9 February 2006. 5 Nicholls FM refused his application to set aside the order dismissing the application because his Honour considered that the applicant's explanation for his non-attendance at the hearing was unsatisfactory. His claims of persecution were mainly founded on his involvement in a political party, the Puthiya Tamilagam ("PT").
