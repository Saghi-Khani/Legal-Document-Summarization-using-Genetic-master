On the latter date, Winning Bid assigned its application messaging services agreement with Sybase to Mobilegate. In this particular case, many days are involved in which contravening conduct occurred. The penalties must be of a level which would make it, as I have already said, commercial suicide to set up a business which has, as its aim, the contravention of the Spam Act . Mr Owen has not sought to rely upon that affidavit in relation to penalty. I shall make some reference to authority touching upon maximum penalty in a moment. In respect of Mobilegate I impose one penalty.
