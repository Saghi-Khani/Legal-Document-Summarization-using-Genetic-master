Under the heading "Claims and Evidence", the Tribunal specifically referred to this document. 16 In written submissions, the applicants' counsel argued that the Tribunal failed to take into account: (1) the first applicant's well-founded fear of persecution, and a specific incident of persecution; (2) the total available country information; and (3) the first applicant's political profile in Australia. The applicants filed their notice of appeal on 27 April 2007. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. The notice of appeal was out of time by one day.
