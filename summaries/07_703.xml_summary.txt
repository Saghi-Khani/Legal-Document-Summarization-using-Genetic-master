On 21 December 2006 the Federal Magistrates Court declined to grant relief. 7 In determining the total value of the net assets owned by the appellant in the main business the Tribunal took into account that the appellant had a 49% shareholding in Quincy during the relevant period. In applying the criterion in cl 845.215 the Tribunal identified the relevant period as being from 27 February 2002 to 27 February 2003, this being the "period of 12 months immediately preceding the making of the application". The first ground is a bare assertion of legal error.
