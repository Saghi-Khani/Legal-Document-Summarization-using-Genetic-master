Charge 14 and Charge 25 It is alleged in these charges that on 24 June 2008 the respondent is guilty of contempt in that, in disobedience of the September 2002 orders and in breach of the November 2007 undertaking, the respondent published on the Adelaide Institute website material which conveyed the imputations which were the subject of paragraphs 2 and 3 of the September 2002 orders. The first argument must also be rejected. The applicant relied on six affidavits of Mr Jones and three affidavits of Mr Lewis. In some charges many documents are relied upon to establish one imputation.
