ASIC submitted that the verification of the debts required on affidavit by s 459Q was to the same standard as the verification of debts in the affidavit required to accompany a statutory demand for other than a judgment debt, pursuant to s 459E of the Act. Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Eastlands Pty Ltd ACN 009 349 053 (No 1) [2006] FCA 1101 (16 August 2006) Mr Carey's motion will therefore be dismissed. Each verifying affidavit relied upon an examination of the books and records of Westpoint Corporation. Each of the debts remained due and payable.
