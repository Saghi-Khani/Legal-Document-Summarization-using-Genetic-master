Questions as to what were the true amount of the appellant's gross income and purchases in the 1997 year were questions of fact. 2 Under s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) an appeal lies to the Federal Court only on a question of law. 5 The appellant's original 1997 return showed sales of $1,101,758 which he said was based on bank deposits. There was no record produced of the unbanked amounts. 7 In evidence before the Tribunal the appellant claimed $240,000 as the amount of his father's contributions.
