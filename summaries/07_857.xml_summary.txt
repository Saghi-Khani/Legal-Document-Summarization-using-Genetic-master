My concern is that GSS may add nothing to the case. Mr Porch relies primarily on the claims against the directors for his argument that there is a need for GSS to prosecute the action. In the parallel proceeding it is alleged that the defendants misused Landmark's intellectual property and copyright in certain works that are similar to the works described in the principal action. Landmark, a company controlled Mr Porch, is a beneficiary of the trust as are the Deans through the Dean Family Trust. Porch v Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 857 (5 June 2007)
