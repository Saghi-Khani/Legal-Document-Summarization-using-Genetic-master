By registering the Domain Names the respondent breached s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , s 42 of the Fair Trading Act , clause (3) of the agreement dated 24 November 2003, and clauses 2, 4 and 5 of the deed dated 16 December 2004. They involve cancellation of the Further Domain Names. The Court made orders as sought by the applicants ( Macquarie Bank Ltd v Seagle (2005) 146 FCR 400 ; [2005] FCA 1239). For these reasons I will not make proposed order 11. 7 The first applicant also discovered that the respondent had registered another domain name, macquariebank.net.
