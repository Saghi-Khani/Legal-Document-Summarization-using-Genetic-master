The resolution of this first issue revolves around two relatively recent appeal court decisions to which I was referred by both counsel: Ms Martin for Ms Stoddart and Mr Cooke QC for the Crime Commission. McPherson JA, therefore, concluded that the Qld Act did not abrogate spousal incrimination privilege by clear words or necessary implication: see at [15]. DOES SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE EXIST AT COMMON LAW? On this issue, Mr Cooke QC also submitted that the Full Court's decision in A emphasised the unqualified obligation to answer questions established by s 30(2) of the Act.
