I have come to the view that whilst the prejudice to which Mr Jones points is a serious one, it does not outweigh the difficulties which would flow from permitting a multiplicity of proceedings. The plaintiffs seek leave to amend their statement of claim to join a fourth plaintiff, Young & Rubicam Brands Holding Pty Limited ( YRB ). No doubt there were good commercial reasons for the course previously followed and indeed for the change of course proposed by the present application. The prejudice to which the defendants point is that the matter, as originally constituted, was ready for a hearing date.
