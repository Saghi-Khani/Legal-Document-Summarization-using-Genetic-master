This is an appeal from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('AAT') given on 13 February 2006 in which the AAT affirmed the respondent's decision not to remit penalties imposed by the respondent on 2 December 2004 for the applicant's failure to lodge her income tax returns for the years ended 30 June 2001 and 2003. There was no evidence before the AAT of that and that does not raise any question of law. That, as I have said, was not known to the respondent at the time the FTL penalty remission decision was made.
