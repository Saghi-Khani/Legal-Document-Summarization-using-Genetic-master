Mr Street SC, who appeared with Mr Romaniuk for CGU, argues that the proceedings in this Court are related to the proceedings brought by Mr Rich and Mr Silbermann against CGU in the Supreme Court. 6 On 27 August 2003, CGU sought orders in the Supreme Court that the proceedings brought by Messrs Greaves, Rich and Silbermann be heard concurrently with the proceedings instituted by ASIC against those individuals. The Trustee has commenced proceedings in this Court against the respondent insurer ('CGU'). The compensation orders were made on the application of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ('ASIC').
