The second respondents are said to be liable to the applicant because they knowingly participated in the first respondent's breach of fiduciary duty. 70 Moreover, the plea of actual knowledge in par 25 insofar as it relates to the male second respondents cannot support a claim that they contravened s 183(2) by being involved in a contravention of s 183(1). It is pleaded as a particular to this paragraph that the acts, conduct and knowledge of each of the second respondents is imputed to all of them. Those two clients would each know that information.
