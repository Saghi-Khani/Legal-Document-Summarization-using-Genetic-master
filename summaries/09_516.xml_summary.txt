APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT  I have given careful consideration to the question of whether I ought to make an order dispensing with the requirement of Part IVA that the Court is to fix a date for group members to opt out of a representative proceeding. The applicants were informed that there was no other policy which responded to the claims made in the proceedings. This includes group members who have been advised that they will not receive any funds from the settlement sum. Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516 (12 May 2009)
