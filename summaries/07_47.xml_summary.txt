Comcare described the injury as 'aggravation of a pre-existing condition of pain in mid thoracic region'. As mentioned at [9] and [14] --- [17] above, the Tribunal accepted Dr Griffith's evidence. 10 Mr Lang's initial claim was determined in accordance with the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 (Cth) (the 1971 Act). This record does not resolve the central issue, namely whether the 'accepted condition' referred to included any aggravation that may have been caused by the 1981 fall. Mr Lang appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Mr Lang was entitled to seek review of that decision.
