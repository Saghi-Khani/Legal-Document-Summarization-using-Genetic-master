On or about 5 April 2007, ACCC issued a notice to Narnia under sub-ss 155(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. That response was false in that Mr Clarke never invoked cl 3 of the agreement and never notified Mr Hack that the $1,800 payment would be sufficient to cover the administrative costs and expenses of ordering and procuring the hairpiece. Mrs Hack then complained to ACCC about Advanced Hair Studios and Mr Clarke. Mr Walsh notified Mr Clarke.
