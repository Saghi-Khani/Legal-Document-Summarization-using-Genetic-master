The second respondent did not seek such an order. 2 Subsequent to delivery of that judgment, the first respondent made an application seeking costs from the applicant on an indemnity basis. 1 This is an application for costs in relation to a proceeding in which I have already given a judgment on 21 August 2008: Logic Group Tyres Pty Limited v Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co Limited [2008] FCA 1297. I granted the applicant and first respondent some time to file and serve submissions as to whether the applicant should pay indemnity costs to the first respondent.
