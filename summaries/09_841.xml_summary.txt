Accordingly, the Tribunal does not accept that the applicant engaged in the conduct otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening his claim to be a refugee and so the Tribunal has disregarded his conduct in determining whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted in China for a Convention reason. As his Honour noted, the Tribunal was obliged to make findings about the appellant's conduct in Australia, before considering the effect of s 91R(3). The Tribunal failed to invite the applicant to establish the purpose of his Falun Gong practice in Australia.
