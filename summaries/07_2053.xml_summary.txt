THE LEGISLATION  7 Part 6 of the BS Act provides for ACMA to allocate, renew and impose conditions on community broadcasting licences. For example, Mr Weaver criticised ACMA's ' common sense ' view that:  'an organisation made [up] mostly of people from outside the licence area is not likely to have the capacity to represent interests that are specific to the community within the licence area.
