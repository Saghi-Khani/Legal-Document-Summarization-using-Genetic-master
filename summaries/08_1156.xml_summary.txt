15 The absurdity is said to result in invalidity because no reasonable person could have devised the 2006 transitional provision; it is a fantastic and capricious law. By reg 4(1) (the 2005 transitional provision) this amendment applied to a visa application made on or after 1 July 2005. 33 The appellant claims that the making of clause 880.230(2) and the 2006 transitional provision changed the character of the fee. That is not the case here. Three grounds were propounded. It thus has no operation if subclause (1) does not apply.
