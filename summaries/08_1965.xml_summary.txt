1 On 5 September 2008 I found that the respondent, Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd ("Morrison Clothing"), and Mr Brian Morrison had committed contempt of Court by failing to comply with paragraph 1 of the orders I made on 28 September 2007 ("the Order"): see Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Morrison Country Clothing Australia Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 604. 3 The applicant seeks an order that Mr Morrison be fined $50,000.00 for his contempt. The matter was finally heard in April 2008. No material was filed on behalf of Mr Morrison or Morrison Clothing.
