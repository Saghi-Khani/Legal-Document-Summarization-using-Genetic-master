CONCLUSION AND ORDERS  Following submissions on costs, on 23 July 2009 the Court made the following orders: The proceeding is discontinued. Ms Dowding explained that on 1 June 2009, she received a notice of General Interest Charge issued by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) dated 28 May 2009 addressed to the third respondent. She told Ms Dowding she would have to provide a letter of authority from the company. In any event, I do not consider that it has been demonstrated that the applicant acted unreasonably in proceeding on 4 June 2009 to seek and obtain freezing orders.
