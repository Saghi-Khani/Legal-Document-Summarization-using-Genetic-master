The Tribunal at [63] accepted that the applicant had practised Falun Gong in Australia with others as he claimed and that he had attended the Falun Gong activities in Australia that he claimed he had attended. This ground must fail. Before the Federal Magistrate in this case, the Minister conceded that the telephone call made to the uncle of the appellant could be construed as the exercise of the power to "invite a person to given additional information". Further the decision record of the Tribunal does not reveal any other jurisdictional error. I consider these were correct findings.
