The power conferred by s 41(2) of the AAT Act is to stay or affect the operation or implementation of a decision. 4 Section s 1317B(1) of the Corporations Act provides that an application may be made to the Tribunal for review of a decision made under the Corporations Act by the Board. The Tribunal declined to make an order under s 35 that the hearing before the Tribunal be in private. No such qualification appears in s 1296. ASIC pointed to such an entry as another example of an implementation of a decision to suspend.
