11 The finding of the Tribunal that the applicant had invented the claim to have been a Falun Gong practitioner since mid 2002 was based on all those matters (which are not said to involve any jurisdictional error) and on his 'limited knowledge about the teachings of Master Li'. Consequently, the contention was that the Tribunal's decision was based upon no evidence and was therefore infected with jurisdictional error. The applicant claims that he observed that his wife practised Falun Gong in China for two months before he left in April 1999. She left Australia in about May 2004.
