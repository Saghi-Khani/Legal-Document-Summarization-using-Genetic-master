9 Oxus Gold's contentions were directed to the following three issues:  (1) whether the jurisdiction of the Federal Court had been properly invoked by reason of the two federal claims founded on contraventions of the TPA, which were pleaded in the applicants' application and statement of claim,  (2) whether in light of the non-disclosure of information by the applicants on the ex parte application, the Court should exercise its discretion to set aside the orders for service out of the jurisdiction,    (3) whether this Court is clearly an inappropriate forum. The applicants thereby terminated the Sale Agreement.
