In my opinion, the matter is so evenly balanced that I regard as the tipping point the nature of the proceedings, being ultimately the winding up of companies, the registered offices of which are in Adelaide. 9 Mention has been made of the fact that Consolidated Byrnes Holdings Limited and Alpha Asset Group Pty Limited have not yet completed filing of their evidence in relation to service of the statutory demands, which was required to be completed by 23 May 2008. I make no special order as to costs. I read some evidence directed particularly to the question of transfer.
