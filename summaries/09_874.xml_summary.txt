Mr Carr sets out in par 4 the reasons why he and the third respondent travelled to Gladstone and visited the members on board the Fitzroy River . Those concerns have been communicated predominantly to Rio Tinto's shipping operations business unit, Rio Tinto Marine. Neither was there any informal agreement or consensus amongst members at the meeting that they would take any industrial action themselves. Paragraph 44 of the affidavit of Michael Clinch provides the basis for what is said to be the claim against the first three respondents. The industrial action by the seamen occurred on the following day.
