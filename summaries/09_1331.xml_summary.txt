I am satisfied that he is an eligible applicant under s 596A. Hughes, in the matter of Firepower Operations Pty Ltd (In Liquidation) [2009] FCA 1331 (5 November 2009) I am also satisfied on the basis of the information in the company search that Mr Johnston was a director, and therefore, an officer, of the company at the time its winding up began. Unlike s 596B of the Corporations Act , the Court does not have a discretion as to whether to order that an examination summons should issue. He is, therefore, a person to whom s 596A(b)(iii) applies.
