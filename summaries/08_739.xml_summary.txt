1 The applicant seeks leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of Federal Magistrate Smith dismissing the applicant's application for judicial review of a decision by the second respondent Refugee Review Tribunal not to grant him a protection visa: see SZLQD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 190. It does not compel the Tribunal to orally give an applicant any particulars of country information which it intends to rely on. The submissions do not address any grounds raised in the proposed notice of appeal. That is not the case. Section 424AA did not apply to his review.
