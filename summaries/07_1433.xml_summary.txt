7 It is common ground that Ross Investments made unsolicited offers to purchase ordinary and cumulative debentures in Cambridge Credit from retail debenture holders by way of the offer documents sent to debenture holders. The word "fair" in s 1019I(2)(c) , in my view, refers to the method by which the estimate is arrived at; it means reasonable, proper or satisfactory. Debenture holders do, however, remain entitled to interest. Plainly, the estimates provided by Mr McGrath are a "fair estimate of the value" of the debentures. Division 5A regulates unsolicited off-market offers to purchase financial products.
