ON JOINDER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAN FISHING INDUSTRY COUNCIL (INC) AS A PARTY AND SPRINGING ORDERS FOR REMOVAL OF RESPONDENTS  Case management conferences were held on 31 July 2006 and 1 August 2006 relating to native title determination applications in the Pilbara and Geraldton regions respectively. The person must have some interest that may be affected by the native title determination. Some of those fisheries are located in the claim area. Nor am I satisfied that the evidence discloses any real basis upon which WAFIC's capacity to participate in the committees to which it has referred would be affected.
