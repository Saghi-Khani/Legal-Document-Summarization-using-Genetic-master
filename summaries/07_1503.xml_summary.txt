Provision is made in s 79(3) of the Casino Control Act 1992 (NSW) for a casino operator to give an order, known as a voluntary exclusion order, made on the person's voluntary application, prohibiting the person from entering or remaining in a casino. Following his losses on 18 May 2004, Mr Foroughi requested that Star City ban him from the casino. However, he said that Star City employees did regularly detect excluded patrons. Findings on credit of Mr Foroughi  49 I reject Mr Foroughi's evidence of the representations which he alleges to have been made to him.
