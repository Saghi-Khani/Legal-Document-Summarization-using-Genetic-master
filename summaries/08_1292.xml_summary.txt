Accordingly, if the respondents' construction of the definition of "building industrial action" in s 36(1) of the BCII Act were accepted, then the respondents would have no case to answer under s 38 of the BCII Act . The expression "a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work" in paras (b) and (c) may as naturally comprehend that which is imposed by a union as by employees. The applicant asserted, and the respondents denied, that there was an "industrial dispute" within the meaning of s 36(4) of the BCII Act . I accept this submission in part.
