It had one point in its favour. 4 Nutrasweet took the position that I was required to find each of the claims (that is both the proposed amended claims and the proposed new claims) were invalid by reason of my finding that the purported invention was obvious. But I would not accede to the application in a case where the successful ground was first raised immediately before trial. 2 The costs incurred in the amendment application are significant. Ajinomoto also filed evidence relating to obviousness. The fight on inventiveness did not proceed because Nutrasweet withdrew from the contest.
