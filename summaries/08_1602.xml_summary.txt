Section 24(1AAA) precludes any appeal to the Court from a judgment of the Court constituted by a single Judge exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the Court in relation to an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. 7 The proceedings are presently listed for mention before me on 11 November 2008. The resources of the Federal Magistrates Court are sufficient to hear and determine the proceeding. The parties neither consent to nor oppose an order for transfer. The parties had filed written submissions setting out their position on the issue of transfer but an order had not yet been made.
