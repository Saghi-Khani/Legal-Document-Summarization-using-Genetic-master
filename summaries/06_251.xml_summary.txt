Plainly, the Tribunal addressed its Article 1C(5) finding on the Appellant's claim to refugee status because of his fear that as a Hazara he would be conscripted by the Taliban to fight for them or, were he to return to Afghanistan in March 2000, be at risk of being killed. Ground 4 also fails. The Taliban were searching for young Hazara Shi'a men. The Tribunal was not satisfied that there was a real chance that harm amounting to persecution would befall the Appellant in the reasonably foreseeable future were he to return to the Markazi Behsud district.
