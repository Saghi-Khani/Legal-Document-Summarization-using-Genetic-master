In its statement of reasons and findings the tribunal set out in detail the appellant's claims and an account of the first hearing in its letter of 8 November. I note that this ground appears to have been argued differently before his Honour. The tribunal was obliged to have regard to the information. 4 The appellant attended at the second hearing and gave further evidence. The interpreter confirmed this was the case. I agree. The only relevance of the two untranslated articles that the appellant explained to the tribunal was that they referred to Ansar Islam.
