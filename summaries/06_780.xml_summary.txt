" 3 The appellant's claims in support of his application for a protection visa were somewhat vague. 1 This is an appeal from a judgment of O'Dwyer FM dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal"): MZWMF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 513.
