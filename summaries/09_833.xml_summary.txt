I adjourned the hearing of that application to permit the legal representative of the respondents to obtain instructions from the respondents as to whether they would be prepared to undertake not to seek to recover costs from Mr Ley personally in the event that Mr Fernando was unsuccessful in his application and costs orders were made against Mr Fernando. Mr Ley was duly appointed as Mr Fernando's tutor in the 2003 proceeding and Freehills agreed to act as Mr Ley's solicitors in relation to that proceeding. He was released from immigration detention on 18 January 2007.
