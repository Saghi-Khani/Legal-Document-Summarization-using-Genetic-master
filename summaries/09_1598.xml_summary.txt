The interests of the holders of policies issued in the course of that part of the business of a foreign general insurer, such as Westport, SRI and SRC, that is carried on outside Australia are based on liabilities of the foreign general insurer arising under contracts of insurance made outside Australia.

Paragraph (b) has no application in the present case. APRA approved the notices of intention on 12 November 2009.
