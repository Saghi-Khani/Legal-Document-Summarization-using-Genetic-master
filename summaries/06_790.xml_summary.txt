Fubilan Catering Services Limited v Compass Group (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 6) [2006] FCA 790 (23 June 2006) The applicants pay any costs of the respondents thrown away by reason of the late commencement of the trial of the action. 7 Mr Rumsley, the solicitor for the applicants, accepted the delay but said that it arose because he arranged the list of documents into chronological order, cross referenced to discovery numbers. The applicants were also directed to deliver their written opening, dramatis personae and chronology to the respondents and the Court by close of business on 9 June 2006.
