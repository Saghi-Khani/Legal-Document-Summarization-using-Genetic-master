The Luxottica Retail Australia Optical Enterprise Agreement 2006-2009 ('the Retail Agreement') governs the industrial relations of the employees engaged at the laboratory and in most of the retail outlets. The AMWU submits that, contrary to the statements, if a 'no' vote resulted it would have the direct and immediate consequence that the extant Retail Agreement and Distribution Agreement would continue to operate. After such termination the relevant Award will apply to laboratory employees. Such documents and evidence are relied upon as establishing that Luxottica conducts a single business. The first issue for consideration is whether the statements were misleading.
