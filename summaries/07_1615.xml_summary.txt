2 The matter came before me for first directions on 13 December 2005. Orders were made that all respondents file and serve fully particularised defences and any cross-claims by 24 February 2006. A Mr Zhang, solicitor, appeared for the first to fourth respondents. 1 On 25 November 2005, the applicant commenced proceedings against the first to fifth respondents for infringement of Australian Patent No 713628. 19 On 15 May 2006, the fifth respondent filed a cross-claim against the first to fourth respondents. The notice of motion seeks declarations and orders against all respondents.
