Mr Benson never made a decision to make a DPO in respect of the taxation liability specified in the purported DPO of 21 May 2008. 51 For the Commissioner, the submission was advanced that, in a relative sense, the assessment debt and the credits which were inserted were minor. Reasonable Grounds? 74 Since 2003 Mr Duly has been dealing with the ATO on behalf of Mr Pattenden and the ACBF Group of Companies in relation to enquiries which later led to the audit. Whether the omission constituted good public administrative practice is for the Commissioner, not the Court, to determine.
