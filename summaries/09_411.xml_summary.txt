The notice of appeal in this Court seeks an order that the Judgment be set aside and an order that the Bankruptcy Notice be stayed until the High Court of Australia has determined the appellant's application for special leave to appeal from a judgment of the New South Wales Court of Appeal (see Miller v Nationwide News Pty Limited [2008] NSWCA 222). The appeal must be dismissed with costs. The Federal Magistrate carefully considered the appellant's application that came before him. On 20 April 2009 I dismissed the appeal and I now publish my reasons.
