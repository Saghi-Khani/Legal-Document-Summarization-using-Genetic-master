Counsel also indicated that the Respondent may wish to formulate a further affidavit addressing reasons why the disclosure of the proposed documents or parts of documents ought not occur. Paragraphs 15, 22 and 23 ought be disclosed. 10 The first question to determine was whether I ought properly receive a further affidavit elaborating upon the basis upon which the claim for public interest immunity had been made in the earlier affidavit of Ms Blackburn sworn 2 March and filed on 6 March 2006. Once satisfied of that matter, the judge might receive the additional material.
