By the Deed Poll as amended, Sonic undertook to each Scheme Participant to procure that the Sonic Purchaser would comply with its obligations under the Scheme and provide the Scheme Consideration. This satisfied condition (a) in cl 7.1 of the Deed Poll. 26 For the above reasons I made the orders on 15 September 2008. As well, I approved the draft explanatory statement to be given by IPN to the IPN Shareholders. At the second court hearing IPN asked that I approve the Scheme subject to certain alterations. 4 The Scheme Meeting was held on 11 September 2008.
