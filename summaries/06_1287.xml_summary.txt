6 On that further consideration, after hearing the appellants' evidence on 29 September 2005, the Tribunal again affirmed the decision of the delegate of the first respondent not to grant protection visas to the appellants. 23 The third ground of appeal relates to the failure by the Tribunal to find that the appellant wife was a member of a particular social group consisting of barren women in Fiji and that, as a result, she would be liable to persecution. The Federal Magistrate consequently dismissed the application. 8 Before the Tribunal both appellants claimed well-founded fear of persecution.
