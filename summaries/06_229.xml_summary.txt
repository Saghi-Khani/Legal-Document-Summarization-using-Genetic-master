In New South Wales the relevant statute was the Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act 1999 (NSW) which came into effect on 9 July 1999. The dispute in this action concerns the entitlement to the amounts recovered by Mr Morton and the company. The investigation which Mr Morton conducted into the affairs of the company was in part funded by the creditors. Mr Morton seeks that approval. Robins assigned his entitlement to RHM. Significant costs continued to be incurred. Eight years have passed since those judgments were obtained. The claims against the remaining defendants were dismissed.
