However, her Honour said that the Tribunal should have attempted to contact the migration agent by telephone when the appellant failed to appear, given that he had earlier requested an oral hearing. 1 The appellant appeals from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia which dismissed his application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal. 6 The Tribunal's decision is dated 12 March 1999. There would have been nothing for the appellant to gain by seeking to address matters other than delay. Her Honour did not err in the exercise of her discretion.
