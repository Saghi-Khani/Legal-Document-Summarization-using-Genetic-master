In Re Application of K , Brownie J at 484 decided that the word "parent" in s 4 of the Immigration Act (as in force at 1991) did not include a person who had adopted a child in another country where that adoption order was not recognised in Australia. Note 1: for young person and parent see section 5. 2 The issue is whether Mrs Waldron is entitled to a double orphan pension, under the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth) (the Act) until Isabelle is adopted under Australian law. The term "adopted" is not defined. The Commonwealth Minister is her guardian.
