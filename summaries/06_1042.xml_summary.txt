Irrespective of the present resort to an application for extension of time to appeal that decision of 10 June 1998 of O'Connor J, the applicant has in any event appealed against the decision of Raphael FM subsequently made on 25 May 2006. Those proceedings constituted of course an attempted review of a Tribunal decision made on 30 December 1997 which was unsuccessful in the Federal Court. The Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error in making this finding. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary.
