The applicant, Ms Asmar, alleges that, notwithstanding Mr Vines' directions, certain employees of the Union, who are members of Mr Bolano's team, have used the resources of the Union to further their campaigns for election. This is because s 201 of the Act requires the Court to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the application, made under s 200, before any inquiry is taken to have been instituted. Nominations closed on 14 October 2009. The employees concerned are Mr Bolano, Mr Martorana and Ms Carmichael. Much of the affidavit evidence relied upon by the applicant contained hearsay.
