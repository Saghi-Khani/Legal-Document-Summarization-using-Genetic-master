6 In all the circumstances I am of the opinion that it is an appropriate exercise of power under s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Act to order that the appeal be dismissed for the failure of the appellant to attend the callover today. 5 I am not satisfied that the appellant has failed to comply with any direction in relation to the filing of amended grounds of appeal. 2 The appellant has sought to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrate's Court given on 29 October 2005: SZFQV v The Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 1405.
