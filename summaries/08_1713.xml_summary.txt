6 The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application under r 44.12(1)(a) on 7 July 2008. Both aspects of this appeal ground relate to the merits of the Tribunal's decision rather than any alleged jurisdictional error. Secondly, the Tribunal misdirected itself when it found that the appellant had not claimed to fear persecution for any other Convention based reason when, according to the appellant, this finding was "completely against" his written claims and evidence during the hearing. The test for leave is well known. The first respondent's delegate refused the application on 23 November 2007.
