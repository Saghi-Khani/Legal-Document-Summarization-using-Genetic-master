On 6 June 2001, a total of US$250,000.00 was transferred to two accounts at the Bank of Queensland Ltd, 93-170415 and 90-170415. Paragraph 7 of those orders of 28 April was in the following terms:  '7. CPFS may be an acronym for Commercial and Primary Financial Services Pty Ltd ("CPFSP/L"). In that affidavit Mr Wallader said:    '1. 21 The order made by Greenwood J in the present case is not one compliance with which will infringe Mr Wallader's privilege against self-incrimination. It is, in my view, capable of applying to affidavit evidence.
