Anying Auburn contends that the Registered Trade Mark should be expunged from the Register for the reasons explained in its Cross-Claim. It was thus the applicants who first pleaded and sought to rely upon the various transactions effected in 2006 and 2007 involving Anying Sydney No 1 and New Century in respect of the Sydney business and An Ying Melbourne and Xinying in respect of the Melbourne business. The cross-claimants allege that Harry Wang expropriated the Anying mark and wrongfully registered in Australia the Registered Trade Mark under the Trade Marks Act . I will make orders accordingly.
