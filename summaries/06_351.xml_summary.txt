6 Mr Forest is a self-represented litigant and I have elected to record these observations in addressing for Mr Forest the concerns he has raised by his Notice of Motion concerning the report. The Applicant in the motion advances the proposition that the report of Dr. Unwin goes beyond an examination of the question of whether the particular condition might be alleviated through the use of the Applicant's assistance dogs, either "Buddy" or "Knuckles" and examines the question of the use of the assistance dogs and comments upon the utility, features and characteristics of the assistance dogs.
