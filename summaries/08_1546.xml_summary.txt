2 At 5.00 pm yesterday, (15 October 2008) the ship 'Samsun Veritas' was arrested in Port Hedland. I was informed that in a practical sense it is possible for the ship to berth at Dampier in about 12 hours' time from its departure from Port Hedland. 1 Early this morning (WST) I made orders permitting a ship that is under arrest in Port Hedland, Western Australia to sail to the Port of Dampier in Western Australia on certain conditions. 4 In support of the application was an unsworn affidavit of Mr Clive Cassin, Admiralty Marshal. These are my reasons.
