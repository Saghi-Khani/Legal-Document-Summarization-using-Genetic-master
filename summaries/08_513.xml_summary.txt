1 This is a notice of motion which is brought by Mr Mark Simonsen to set aside orders of the Court that were made by consent on 10 March 2008 allowing an appeal against the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court and ordering that the bankruptcy of Mr Legge be annulled. However, Mr Simonsen did not serve the notice of motion and the affidavit before the expiry of the time limit. Parties to that application were Mackinlays, Mr Legge, and it also appears from the appeal book that the Official Trustee appeared before the Federal Magistrates Court with leave.
