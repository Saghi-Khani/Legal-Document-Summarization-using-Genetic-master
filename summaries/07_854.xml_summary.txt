In consideration of the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal is not satisfied that being low caste (Dalit and Sindhi), without more, means that there is a real chance of the applicant being persecuted as contemplated by the Convention, by the Shiv Sena, and/or the Indian authorities, and/or upper caste people. The appellant's application to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of this decision of the Tribunal was dismissed. The first ground of appeal is made out. TRIBUNAL MEMBER: Yes, I understand that. It contained further evidence that the appellant sought to adduce on his appeal.
