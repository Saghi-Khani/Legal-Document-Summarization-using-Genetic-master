Second, the appellant alleged that the Tribunal acted with bias and refused the application without evidence. The information about the treatment of practitioners in China was quite inconsistent with the description which the appellant supplied. The Tribunal had regard to his claims about his activities in relation to Falun Gong since coming to Australia. 32 The appellant, in oral submissions, raised a further new ground namely that the first respondent did not provide him with its written outline of submissions before the morning of the Tribunal hearing. That decision was dated 13 May 2005 and handed down 2 June 2005.
