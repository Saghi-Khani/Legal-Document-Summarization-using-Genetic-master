The requisite opinion would have to be clearly expressed. The Tribunal concluded:     "... 25 Mr Horan submitted that, in the present case, the MRT had been required to make a finding as to whether the appellant was relevantly the "spouse" of the nominator within the meaning of reg 1.15A. The appellant then sought review of the MRT's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. Much will depend upon whether the approach taken by Ryan J in Meroka , which recognises the possibility that a statutory declaration may state an opinion "implicitly", is good law.
