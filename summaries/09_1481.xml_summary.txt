As noted in my earlier Reasons, the plaintiffs were appointed as joint administrators of the defendant in the UK Proceeding on 11 November 2009. "FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVE" AND "FOREIGN PROCEEDING"  Under para (e) of Article 21(1) of the Model Law, I made Order 3 of 30 November 2009 entrusting the administration and realisation of all of the defendant's assets located in Australia to the plaintiffs. Schedule B1 provides for the administration of companies. Two remaining matters call for discussion. The UK Proceeding brought under the Insolvency Act was a collective judicial proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency.
