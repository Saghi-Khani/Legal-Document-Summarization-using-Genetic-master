In the course of the second Tribunal hearing, the Tribunal member raised with the appellant the fact that he had not mentioned these matters before. The Applicant said that it was because the interpretation was so bad. The appeal to this Court is from the Magistrate's order in relation to the second Tribunal decision. Such information was information that the appellant gave for the purposes of his application for review to the Tribunal. 18 The first respondent sought to meet this possible argument by submitting that what the Tribunal relied upon was not 'information' within s 424A(1).
