The Tribunal failed to accept the appellant's evidence about his health cover in Australia. As noted above, the appellant argued that the judgment of the Federal Magistrate disclosed appellable error for another reason. Regulation 1.41(1) provided that the Minister must specify, in relation to each subclass of student visa, an assessment level to which an applicant for a student visa would be subject. Item 5A407 contemplated various possibilities. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant met the English proficiency requirement and had sufficient health insurance. The Tribunal handed down its decision on 3 October 2008.
