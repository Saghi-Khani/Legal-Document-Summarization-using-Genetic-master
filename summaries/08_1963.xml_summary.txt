Paragraph 10 is an order that could be made. 39 If any of the prayers for relief were struck out as sought, the Court would not thereby be giving judgment in favour of the defendant for the proceeding or part of the proceeding. Mr Boris Ganke has been a director of the defendant since 1976. Relief may be sought even with respect to a listed company. The order reflects the plaintiffs' pleaded case. Mr Ganke is a substantial shareholder of the defendant. Northern Star also owns about 20% of the capital of NBBC. 25 The plaintiffs oppose the application.
