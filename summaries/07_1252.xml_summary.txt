On 16 May 2002, the appellant entered into a contract to purchase the business from the first respondent. The appellant claimed damages in respect of capital loss, trading losses, financing costs, income forgone and losses arising from the purchase of the motor vehicles which the appellant acquired as part of the business. Under this head, the appellant claimed the amount of $25,197. In my view, the Federal Magistrate erred in declining to award damages under this head of claim. On taking over the business, Mr McKenzie started assisting the remaining sales representative, Mr Milton, in sales activities.
