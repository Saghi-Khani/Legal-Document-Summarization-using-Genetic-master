16 Accordingly, I propose to direct the Registrar to refuse to accept the documents that Mr Bowen has attempted to file this day. This Court has no appellate jurisdiction in respect of decisions of the Tribunal, which is set up under State law. In his material, Mr Bowen invokes ss 52 and 51A of the Trade Practices Act . The first two respondents then sought an order for costs. Costs to follow the event. None of these things, so far as I can see, would have any chance of giving rise to a cause of action justiciable in this Court.
