1 At one point I was minded to require the administrator to pay all the plaintiff's costs on a solicitor and client basis. First, there is the plaintiff's application to extend the time within which to appeal the administrator's rejection of his proofs of debt. 9 In my view the plaintiff is entitled to his costs up to 11 October 2006 taxed on a party and party basis and thereafter on a solicitor and client basis. Having failed to seek directions to protect his position the administrator put himself at risk on costs. The offer was rejected.
