This is an appeal against a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing the appellant's application to set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( the RRT ) for jurisdictional error ( SZINQ v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2009] FMCA 469). The RRT's reasons do not disclose any irrational or unreasonable assessment of the appellant's claims and evidence. The first ground alleges that the RRT erred by failing to consider the appellant's claims. The fourth ground, alleging a breach of s 91R(3) of the Migration Act , is new. It simply found that evidence to lack credibility.
