TRIBUNAL'S DECISION  5 The appellant attended the Tribunal hearing on 18 October 2005 and gave oral evidence. Before it can be argued in this Court, the appellant must demonstrate that it is expedient and in the interests of justice that new grounds of appeal be raised: SZINP v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1747 at [22] . 12 The Federal Magistrate also found the Tribunal properly understood the claims and found there was no well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. The affidavit has no relevance to jurisdictional error.
