The first question raised again the issue dealt with by Finn J, whether the Tribunal had failed to appreciate the significance of the word "all" in s 24A of the FOI Act and had failed to understand properly, and to carry out a critical evaluation of, the steps taken by the respondent. The file held by Mr Atkins had been provided to the appellant in any event. The refusal of the Federal Magistrates Court to receive the appellant's post-hearing submissions was proper. Leave would be refused because the argument could not succeed. The appellant appealed to this Court.
