Mr and Mrs Cassimatis drew attention to observations concerning s 440A(2) made by Hamilton J in TCS Management Pty Ltd v CTTI Solutions Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 830. The administrators voice the opinion in their report (p 24) that Storm Financial is presently insolvent. For all of these reasons I am not, in terms of s 440A(2) of the Act, satisfied that it is in the interests of Storm Financial's creditors for the company to continue under administration rather than be wound up. Costs. I grant leave. Should the winding up application be adjourned?
