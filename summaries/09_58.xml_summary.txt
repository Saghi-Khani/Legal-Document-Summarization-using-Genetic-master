It follows that the prohibition against the ordering of costs contained in s 824(1) applies in each of the present proceedings. In this case, however, the applicants argue the Workplace Relations Act had no application to the first respondent at all, and the matter did not, therefore, arise under the Act. In proceedings QUD 481 of 2006, the applicants filed a submission on costs on 27 August 2008. The Etheridge Shire Council did not institute either proceeding. For that reason also, I would not award costs to the State of Queensland in that proceeding.
