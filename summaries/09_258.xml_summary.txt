Disclosure on day 3 of the trial  About a week after 26 March 2008 I was informed by Karen Carey that at the commencement of day 3 of the hearing, whilst I was not present in the Court, Justice Gilmour raised with counsel the issue that one of his brothers-in-law had been an investor in York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd, a company associated with the Westpoint Group. He said that he would take the matter up with Lanepoint's counsel. Mr Carey states that the charges concerned alleged insolvent trading. MR DE KERLOY: Yes. HIS HONOUR: Very well.
