Since the tribunal accepted them, I have treated the claims as facts found by it. After making that finding, the tribunal needed to consider whether the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of his political opinions and whether he would fear to express them, were he returned to China. (cf: Appellant S395 216 CLR at 493 [51] per McHugh and Kirby JJ). The appellant's friend survived the accident but was paralysed permanently. By late 2003 he had suffered for having engaged in political activity. The government authorities did not respond directly. Each is related.
