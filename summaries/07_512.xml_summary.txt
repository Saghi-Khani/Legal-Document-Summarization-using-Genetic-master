4 The present application is said to be made by the applicants to reinstate the dismissed applications and to set aside the orders made on 26 April 2006 requiring the filing of a new application. In these circumstances, in my view, there is a significant doubt whether Mr Black's firm has been duly authorised to act. There was no application to prevent the dismissal made prior to 2 November 2006 despite an inconclusive meeting of the claim group on 5 August 2006. However, in fact the claim had a substantial area of overlap with the Boonthamurra country claim.
