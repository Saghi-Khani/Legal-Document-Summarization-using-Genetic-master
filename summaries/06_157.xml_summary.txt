The consideration received from those sub-distributors has been included in the calculation of the actual loss claimed by Loncaric and Carlon Pty Limited. Burchett J made a similar order in Oraka Pty Ltd v Leda Holdings Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 41-558. Whether such an order should be made is for the discretion of the Court in each case. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Global Prepaid Communications Pty Ltd (ACN 095 154 108) (inliquidation) (No 2) [2006] FCA 157 (27 February 2006) There is no reason to limit the liability of the respondents on that account.
