The amendment is to change the name of the vessel from "George T" to "Sea Coral". In the case of the Helene Roth [1980] QB 273, Sheen J said at 281, as follows: Merchant ships move freely all over the world. I accept that the solicitors for the plaintiff have, for this reason, not been able to effect service within the previous 12 month period of the writ in rem. 4 In my view, those observations are applicable to the circumstances of this case. The evidence shows that in the last year the vessel has not visited an Australian port.
