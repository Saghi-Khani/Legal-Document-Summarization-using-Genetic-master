Section 600B empowers the Court to "set aside or vary" a resolution passed on the casting vote of the person presiding at the meeting of creditors. (2) On 18 January 2006, Fyna Formwork (NSW) Pty Ltd paid $5,000 into Hamiltons' trust account. The DCT is bound by the DOCA. Mr Hamilton analysed Wellnora's transactions with those related entities, as defined in s 9 of the Act, that were creditors of Wellnora at the date of his appointment. This would leave $42,500. Mr Hamilton was not in a position as company administrator to pursue those inquiries.
