I will order that the first and second defendants pay the costs of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation of the adjournment. The extension of the terms and conditions of that loan are said on one view to constitute incurring a liability other than in the usual course of business. Secondly, the winding-up order made on 29 February 2008 will be stayed until 4.00pm on 21 May 2008. The application for termination has been listed for hearing this morning. 4 The company has fully paid that amount of money. Those returns, I understand, were lodged on 9 April 2008.
