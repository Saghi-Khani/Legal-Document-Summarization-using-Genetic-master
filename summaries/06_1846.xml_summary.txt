12 The application made ex parte today will therefore be dismissed. The applicant has, from time to time, purchased t-shirts which could be tendered in evidence in any proceeding brought in support of any claimed infringement of its intellectual property rights. Solicitor's letters were sent threatening action unless the respondents took certain remedial action. Various undertakings were sought from the stall holders. 2 In early May 2006 the applicant was again advised that there were stalls at the market selling t-shirts bearing the pictures. Despite this, the t-shirts continue to be sold.
