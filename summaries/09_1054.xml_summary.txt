A grant of leave can be made subject to conditions directed at minimising interference with the orderly winding up of the company in liquidation: Oceanic Life Ltd v Insurance and Retirement Planning Services Pty Ltd at 1159. Furthermore, claims against Nericon cannot be sustained unless CALM succeeds in its claims against the first and second respondents. On the respondents' case, it is Mr Austin and Bedrock who are the real perpetrators of the contraventions about which the applicant complains in the proceedings. Meanwhile, if it considers it appropriate CALM may lodge a proof of debt with the liquidator.
