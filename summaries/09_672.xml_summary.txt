On 21 April 2008, Mrs Vranic notified Centrelink of her intention to claim a Newstart allowance. Similarly, by clause 5 of Table B, once Mrs Vranic has been receiving for a continuous period of at least nine months a social security benefit (or other entitlement identified in clause 5) she is entitled to then receive the higher rate of benefit. It follows that pursuant to s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) the respondent is entitled to judgment in the proceeding. However, the contentions are these. On 18 October 2007, Mrs Vranic departed from Australia.
