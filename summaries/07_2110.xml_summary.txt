1 I made orders earlier today including orders for the discharge of injunctions previously made against each of the respondents. 3 In an ex tempore judgment I granted the stay of execution and extended the injunctions. Clough Engineering Ltd v Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd [No 4] [2007] FCA 2110 (21 December 2007) 6 An application for leave to appeal against the orders could be heard as early as 8 February 2008. I conclude that in the context of an application for a stay, therefore, that Clough's construction of that clause is reasonably arguable.
