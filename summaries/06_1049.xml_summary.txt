67 John Holland was entitled, by Mr Wild, summarily to terminate Mr Serventi's employment. Mr Serventi commenced employment with John Holland as General Manager of Gridcomm and shortly thereafter became a director of GridComm. Mr Power was then the General Manager of a Transfield subsidiary. However, I reject the suggestion that either Mr Sasse or Mr Wild had no serious objection to Mr Serventi's giving his son the use of the vehicles and that they did not honestly believe that such warranted his dismissal for misconduct. Mr James' evidence must be accepted. My answer would not change.
