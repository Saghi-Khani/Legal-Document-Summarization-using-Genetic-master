Only Mr Zeitoun made further submissions by letter dated 30 May 2006. Counsel also relied on the evidence of Mr Merrick concerning the execution of a second deed of undertaking. In both his defence and oral evidence, the fourth respondent admitted selling counterfeit Nokia branded goods. He deposed to having purchased a variety of products bearing Nokia Trade Marks from these premises. "  He denied the alleged trade mark infringements. The applicant submitted that, if the first respondent did not sell counterfeit Nokia products, then the fact that it received stock from third parties would appear to be irrelevant.
