Walsh v University of Technology, Sydney [2007] FCA 1288 (15 August 2007) 6 Accordingly, I order that the proceedings brought by Mr Walsh be dismissed with costs. I have considered the application and the draft statement of claim. The relief sought in this matter is not relief which this Court, in any event, would have power or jurisdiction to grant. Having regard to the impossibility, in a practical sense, of responding to these allegations, I do not think the draft statement of claim improves the position in this case. I have considered the application and the draft statement of claim.
