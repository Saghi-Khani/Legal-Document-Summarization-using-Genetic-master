At that time, the applicants alleged, amongst other things, that those respondents had infringed the first applicant's copyright in the 42 episode television drama series entitled "Twin of Brothers" . Before the Further Amended Statement of Claim was filed, a Notice of Ceasing to Act was filed on behalf of the second and fourth respondents. Section 90(2) of the Act provides that copyright subsists in a cinematograph film if the film was made in Australia. The second and fourth respondents took no further part in the proceedings after 8 October 2008.
