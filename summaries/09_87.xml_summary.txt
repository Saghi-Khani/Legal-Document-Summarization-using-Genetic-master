Based upon the facts, Keycorp submits that no basis exists for preliminary discovery. Mr Dukellis was informed by email dated 1 August 2008 from Mr Carr that Keycorp did not wish to proceed with any negotiations. On 18 August 2008 Mr Moxon forwarded to Ms Letford a draft letter offering to purchase the business for $31,500,000. Due diligence commenced on that day. HID has also foreshadowed a possible claim under the principles of promissory estoppel. It submits that HID should have made inquiries of Gemalto to ascertain whether it had any exclusive arrangements with Keycorp.
