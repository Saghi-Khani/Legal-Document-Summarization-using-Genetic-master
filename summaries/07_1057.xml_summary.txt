48 I am, in consequence, unable to agree with the view of Beaumont and von Doussa JJ in Western Australia v Ward (FC) that s 225 does not limit the jurisdiction of the Court solely to defining the rights and interests of the persons who make a s 61 native title determination application. Prior to this Mr McKenzie had, by virtue of s 84(3) of the NT Act become a respondent party to the Kokatha Native Title Claim. It again overlapped in part the area of the overlap proceedings. (i) Must a s 225 determination be made?
