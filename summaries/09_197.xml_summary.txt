Communication to the applicant was also carried out by people other than Yat Tan. Ground 6 The learned Federal Magistrate made error of law by holding at [64] that if all the appellant's evidence is accepted it would only constitute negligence. He was not suggesting that 'the firm', as opposed to Mr Yat Tan, had the responsibilities of a registered migration agent. DIAC was on constructive notice that Mr. Yat Tan was not the migration agent or the authorised recipient acting for the applicant. That finding was open to his Honour and no appellable error is shown.
