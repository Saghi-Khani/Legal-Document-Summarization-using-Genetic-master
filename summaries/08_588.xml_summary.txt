1 The matter currently requiring resolution is an application by the second respondent, Gunns Limited ("Gunns"), for an order that the applicant, Lawyers For Forests Inc ("LFF"), provide security for its costs in the proceeding in such amount as the Court determines. It would not be a proper exercise of the discretion to award security for costs simply to do so because an impecunious applicant may be ordered to pay costs. 3 Under s 487(3) of the EPBC Act , LFF has standing to bring this proceeding as a person aggrieved by the Minister's decision. That submission is rejected.
