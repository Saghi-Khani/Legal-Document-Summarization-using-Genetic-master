Counsel for the respondent suggests that the evidence relating to the choice of applicant's counsel indicated that the action was capricious. 23 Mr Phillips also deposes that he had formed the view that the applicant would be unlikely to retain experienced corporation litigation solicitors in Brisbane on the basis that the majority would be conflicted from acting against the interests of the State of Queensland. 1 The respondent brings a notice of motion seeking that the proceeding be transferred to the Queensland District Registry of the Federal Court of Australia. I am unable to agree with that submission.
