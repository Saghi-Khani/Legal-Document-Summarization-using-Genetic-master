8 Mr Priestley submits that s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act creates judicially enforceable rights regarding the independence and impartiality of courts which must be recognised by a court exercising jurisdiction in the ACT. For these reasons, s 79 of the Judiciary Act does not operate to make s 21(1) of the Human Rights Act applicable to the present proceedings, which involve the application and interpretation of Commonwealth, not Territory, laws. It is the constitutional challenge that is the matter presently for determination. That is not, however, conclusive of whether or not the Human Rights Act applies.
