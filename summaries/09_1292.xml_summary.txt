These proceedings be heard immediately following Action NSD 408/2008, or as that judge directs. By reference to the orders made 23 June 2009, Allphones has provided discovery as has the applicant and first cross-respondent. However, it is a primary issue in the proceeding before me. Weimann v Allphones Retail Pty Ltd (No 3) [2009] FCA 1292 (11 November 2009) Counsel for the applicant foreshadowed that the applicant was considering making an application to consolidate the proceedings with the ACCC proceedings before Justice Foster.
