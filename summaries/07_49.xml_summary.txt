I propose to do it on a staged basis covering security for costs up to the point of trial. The respondents have engaged representation in Brisbane. The respondents seek its transfer to the Brisbane Registry. In this case the respondents have provided evidence, which is not contested, of costs estimates on a party-party basis with two different figures dependent upon whether the proceedings are to go ahead in Perth or in the Brisbane registry of the Court. 4 The applicant has not been particularly forthcoming about the impact of a security order on his ability to conduct these proceedings.
