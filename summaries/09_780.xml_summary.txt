I therefore order the respondents/cross-claimants pay the applicant/cross-respondent's costs of the proceedings as agreed or taxed. There was another offer made on 30 January 2009, again, without prejudice save as to costs. The remaining issue is the respondents' reference to Order 62 rule 36A(2) of the Federal Court Rules . It does not seem to me that there is any conduct of the respondents in this matter that would justify the making of an indemnity costs order. The first offer was made on 27 May 2008. The second and third offers stand alone.
