The Magistrate determined that the applicant was a person who was eligible for surrender to the Republic of Croatia pursuant to s 19(9) of the Extradition Act . Such reversals accordingly do not support the claim that the applicant would be prejudiced at his trial before the Croatian judiciary as a result of his nationality. The applicant also seeks to tender all material which was accepted into evidence by the Magistrate but in respect of which the respondent takes objection in this Court. The Human Rights Watch report refers to arrests for war crimes in the Republic of Croatia.
