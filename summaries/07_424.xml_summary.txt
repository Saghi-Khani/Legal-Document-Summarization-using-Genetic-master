The Tribunal's decision  5 The Tribunal considered the appellant's evidence given to the first Tribunal on 1 November 2004. 33 In my view, there are little or no prospects of success in respect of this ground of appeal. Ground of Appeal 2  26 The appellant claims lack of procedural fairness in that the Tribunal did not give him a reasonable opportunity to respond to evidence that Awami League activists could live in Bangladesh without persecution. 17 Accordingly the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application. ORDERS   1. The appellant was legally represented by counsel in the Court below.
