In coming to that view the Tribunal referred to the well-known authority of Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government & Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437. 2 It was accepted that their claim for protection from potential persecution was based, first of all, upon their Muslim activities and Muslim religion and, secondly, upon their membership of the Congress Party. 5 The appellants seek to reargue that conclusion and particularly stress what is said to be the inconsistency involved. The appeal is dismissed. A significant plank of the case before the Tribunal related to an incident in March 2006.
