The Tribunal made reasoned findings in respect to the Appellant's claims based on his religion and political opinion. Section 424AA could only apply in this case to the evidence of the appellant's son. Rather, the Tribunal found that there was no real chance that the appellant would suffer persecution in consequence of that policy if he returned to China. No claim was made by him that he feared persecution because of his involvement as a Christian in Australia. Accordingly, s 91R(3) did not require that his conduct be disregarded. This ground fails.
