28 At the hearing of the application for the review of the sequestration order before the Federal Magistrate, his Honour had evidence that the appellant had not made or attempted to make the first three payments under the instalment order on the due dates. The power of the court to go behind the bankruptcy notice is referred as being a matter of course for discretion. Avco assigned that debt to the respondent. The purport of the appeal is to have the proceedings remitted back to the Local Court so that the case can be reheard.
