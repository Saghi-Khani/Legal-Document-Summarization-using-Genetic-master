25 The evidence showing Nylex's marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of competing Nylex branded products throughout Australia and in New Zealand was overwhelming and was not contested at all by Nylex during the interlocutory hearing before me. 8 By that application, Gardena sought to hold Nylex to the contract which it made with Gardena until the expiry of that contract on 31 December 2008.
