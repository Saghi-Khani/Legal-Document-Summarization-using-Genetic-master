4 The second note to s 61(1) refers to s 251B as stating what it means for a person or persons to be authorised by all of the persons in the native title claim group. Section 66B(4) provides that the Registrar must amend the Register to reflect an order made under that section. 7 Neither Mr Little nor Mr Murray appeared on the hearing of the application. This may not be all persons comprising ' the applicant '. I put the relevance of this evidence to the questions arising under O 6 r 9 to one side for present purposes.
