WHETHER NEED FOR NOTIFICATION OF HEARING OF DEFAULT JUDGMENT  11 The eighty-third and ninety-second respondents may not have been aware of the hearing on 14 November 2007 (albeit that, in the case of the eighty-second respondent, he has been personally served with the Notice of Motion for orders in default and affidavit in support). Order 35A itself imposes no constraints upon the relief sought. 27 The applicant therefore seeks an order as to costs against each defaulter. 20 The defaulters are deemed to have made admissions of the facts pleaded in the Statement of Claim.
