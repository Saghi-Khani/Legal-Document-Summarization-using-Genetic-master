The applicant also asks the Court to make a finding that the respondent had breached the award by failing to pay employee apprentices in South Australia the fares and travel patterns allowance (cl 38) in respect of each day when those apprentices attended trade school. On occasion, apprentices attending trade school went to work sites as part of their training. But if teaching a trade was the primary purpose --- and work for the master was only secondary --- then it was a contract of apprenticeship. 22 Mr Harrison said that other apprentices employed by the respondent attended trade school at Marleston.
