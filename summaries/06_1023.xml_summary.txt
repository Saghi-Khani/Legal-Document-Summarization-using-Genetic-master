16 I consider that from a practical point of view, having regard to the primary relief which was sought on an injunctive basis, Lion Nathan succeeded in its application by having the meeting proposed to be held on 20 October 2005 restrained, and was also successful in having Coopers Brewery put out further supplementary information to shareholders in the form which I described in the order of 18 November 2005, a modified explanatory memorandum. For that reason an interlocutory injunction was granted. I reserved the costs of the application for further consideration. The plaintiff have leave to discontinue the proceeding.
