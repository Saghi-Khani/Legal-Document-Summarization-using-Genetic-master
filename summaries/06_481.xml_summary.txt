Order 52 rule 15(2) provides that a Court or a Judge may give leave to file and serve a Notice of Appeal 'for special reasons' . 5 The applicant seeks to appeal from his Honour's decision. Another member of that Tribunal determined, on 27 April 2005, that the respondent should pay the applicant's costs up to and including the time of receipt by the applicant's solicitors of a letter of offer of settlement from the respondent on 21 August 2002. The applicant clearly lacks any reasonable prospects. That was a matter within its discretion.
