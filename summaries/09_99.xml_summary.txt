In that case, Heerey J observed that the decision of the High Court in SZBYR & Anor v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor (2007) 235 ALR 609 impliedly overruled a substantial body of authority in the Federal Court in which it was held that an assessment of whether the Tribunal has complied with section 424A(1) requires close attention to the reasons of the Tribunal. The only inference therefore available was that the Tribunal did not consider the information to be relevant. This is an impermissible claim for merits review.
