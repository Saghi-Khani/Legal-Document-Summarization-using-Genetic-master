Conclusion I will make the following orders:  Action SAD 153 of 2008  The application of the first and second respondents to strike out paragraphs 82, 84, 91, 92, 97, 106.6 and 106.7 is refused. Paragraph 52 contains a plea of what are alleged to be verbal statements made by Ms McFarlane to Mr Humphries at the showroom in August 2006. There are two notices of motion before the Court. Mr Humphries claims that, once he became aware of the misleading or deceptive conduct, he rescinded the property contracts. Those alleged representations are then set out.
