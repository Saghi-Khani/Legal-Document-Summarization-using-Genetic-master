Such section provides for the forfeiture to the Commonwealth of boats, traps and other things used in offences against various provisions of that Act. The Court has concluded that a contravention of a statute may occur in the absence of a commission of an offence or without a finding of guilt. Nevertheless, the applicant has contravened s 42 of the Migration Act and the ship was forfeited from the time it entered Australia, as was found in Tran No. The Court does not conclude that one must be convicted of an offence for there to be an automatic forfeiture. 1 ').
