However, in my view, for the following reasons, the appeal also fails on another ground. Further, the appellant said that five policemen broke into his home on 17 May 2005 intending to arrest him. 17 Before the Federal Magistrate it was contended that the appellant's reference to "my previous statements" in his post-hearing statement (see [5] above), did not refer to the written statement which accompanied the visa application and referred only to his evidence given before the Tribunal. The delegate made adverse credibility findings in respect of the appellant. The appellant gave evidence at the hearing.
