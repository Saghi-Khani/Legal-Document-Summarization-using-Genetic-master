(2) The Foreign Minister made jurisdictional error in making the determination of 14 July 2008. Accordingly, whether or not the Foreign Minister's determination that the applicant is a person whose presence in Australia is, or would be, contrary to Australia's foreign policy interests is a matter that is capable of judicial review, the ground of denial of procedural fairness in relation to the making of the determination is not made out. This proceeding is concerned with at least one migration decision, being the Tribunal's decision of 4 February 2009.
