Only the claims of the non-funded group members, including those late non-funded group members who were included in the proposed settlement as a result of my judgment of 26 August 2008, remain to be assessed. In accordance with clause 9.1, any payment of administration costs from the interest accrued on the settlement sum requires the approval of the Court. This is so because the Scheme primarily provides for the application for specific formulae to objective data. The reason why that is so is obvious.
