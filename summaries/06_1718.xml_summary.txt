It was pleaded in [113] that the applicant and CCUSA made a contract (the main contract) whereby CCUSA would act as the applicant's certified sponsor in obtaining work in one of the USA camps during the 1999 USA summer/Australian winter. SAFE provided such insurance. Clause 5 extends to 'costs and expenses (including any existing unsatisfied costs order)'. Further in [114] that CCUSA promised the applicant the Insurance Quality Representation was true. On its face it is a mutual release between the parties to the deed, namely the applicant and SAFE. Our policy has no excess on claims.
