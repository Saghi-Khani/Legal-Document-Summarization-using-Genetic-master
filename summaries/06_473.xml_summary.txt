On 7 October 2005, the appellant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking orders, inter alia, that the judgment in default be set aside, and the matter be reinstated. I would refuse leave to appeal from that decision. His Honour was satisfied that the Tribunal afforded the appellant an adequate opportunity to be heard in relation to both the question of the appellant's subjective fear of persecution, and his role as President of the Youth Council. On 17 November 1996, Mr Davindra Mendis was said to have committed suicide. Indeed, it directly contradicts that claim.
