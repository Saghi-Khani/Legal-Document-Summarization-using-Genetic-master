63 In my view, the evidence supports the conclusion that, in the circumstances, the Department did not take reasonable steps to notify the applicant that the Minister would consider whether to cancel his visa. In Minister v George , the Department sent two letters to the visa holder. In the present case, the respondent continued to give the Kalgoorlie address after the Notice was returned unclaimed and the decision was made. 2 The applicant has an extensive criminal record in Australia. Parliament may do so in terms that dispense with any further requirements of procedural fairness.
