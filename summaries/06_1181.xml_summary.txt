The Court considered it relevant that the respondent sought to enforce a State law in a State court. Consequently, the cessation of the exception in reg 4.55(1) by application of reg 4.55(2) in six months time would not extinguish the right of appeal under s 853 of the Workplace Relations Act which BHP Billiton has and may bring in respect of any decision of the Commissioner under s 44 of the Workplace Relations Act which appealed to the Industrial Appeal Court. The application by the Union is directed to reinstatement of Mr Furulyas' employment status.
