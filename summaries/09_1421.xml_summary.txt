His Honour did not appear to consider any other relevant factors in the exercise of his discretion. The fact the appellants have provided a reasonable explanation as to why they failed to comply with the requirements of reg 8.09(1) is a matter which weighs in favour of granting an extension of time. GROUNDS OF APPEAL  (i) Disqualification issue The appellants claim that Phipps FM should have disqualified himself from hearing the application because he had heard a similar matter previously. The appellants are undischarged bankrupts. The respondent also relies on the creditors' approval of his claim for remuneration.
