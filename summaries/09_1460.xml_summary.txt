For these reasons, I think that Bitech's rejection of Flameglow's 23 May 2008 offer was not unreasonable. It did not cross-claim against Bitech. Flameglow tenders on the question of costs in the proceeding against it a letter from its solicitors (Donaldson Walsh) to DLA Phillips Fox dated 23 May 2008. In its Calderbank offer, Garth Living did not offer to pay Bitech's costs of its Cross-Claim. Bunnings has not made out a case for indemnity costs. PROCEEDING NSD 2056 OF 2007  Hotpoint is the sole respondent in this proceeding. I will make orders accordingly.
