5 On 26 September 2006, Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees filed a motion seeking orders that Mr Upton provide security for Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees' costs of the appeal in the sum of $25 000 (based on a three day hearing) and that the appeal be stayed until such security is provided or until further order. Heerey J dealt comprehensively with each issue raised by Mr Upton in the proceeding below and forcefully and convincingly rejected his claims. 6 The Court's power to order security for costs is found in s 56 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
