Nor does the reasoning in the report explain why Seven's IMC strategy, if successful, would have yielded benefits comparable to the average deal premium paid by the 49 strategic acquirers identified by Mr Salter. Seven Network Limited v News Limited (No 14) [2006] FCA 500 (5 May 2006) Thus only two of the transactions involve mergers between Australian media companies. As such, in my opinion, the appropriate IMC premium range which I have applied is 10% to 20%. In his report, Mr Salter goes beyond this assumption and expresses the opinion that the assessment was in substance correct.
