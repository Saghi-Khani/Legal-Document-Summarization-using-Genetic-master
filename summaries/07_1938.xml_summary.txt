Counsel appeared for the first respondent, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship ("the Minister"). 8 Counsel for the Minister also invited me to make an order for costs against the appellant and to fix those costs at $2,800. Even if the error that it made was an error within jurisdiction, it seemed to me the system had failed the appellant, because the Tribunal had not given its full attention to every possible issue that arose in the case. The appeal be dismissed pursuant to s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of  Australia Act 1976 (Cth).
