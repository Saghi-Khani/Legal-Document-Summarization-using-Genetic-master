The Western Australian proceeding is not listed before me but is listed before a judge in the Perth Registry tomorrow. The first was that in National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v The Sentry Corporation 19 FCR 155 the Court had said that if that party or another party wishes to have the proceeding conducted or continued in another place, he may apply to the Court for an order under s 48, or O 10 r 1(2)(f). In my opinion, s 48 empowers a court in a proceeding to transfer that proceeding to any place specified in the order.
