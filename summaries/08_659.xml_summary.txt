10 On 21 May 2007 the land council filed a third list identifying twenty-two persons whose evidence may need to be preserved. In my view a fair allocation of the costs burden would be that the Birri-Gubba People pay 50% of the costs of the State relating to its preparation for and appearance at directions hearings between 1 December 2006 and 17 October 2007 in relation to the issue of what evidence ought be preserved. Draft orders were circulated by both the applicant group and Queensland. The Birri-Gubba People have not yet served any connection material.
