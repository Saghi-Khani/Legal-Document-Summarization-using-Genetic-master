The submissions on the s 85A ruling  8 Ms Phillips of counsel for the applicants submitted that s 85A(1) of the Act applied to this matter because it was an application under s 81 of the Act that related to native title. Secondly, the relief sought in the applicants' notice of motion does not refer to s 66B. The Full Court therefore ruled that the costs issues were to be determined under section 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 . 4 This matter came on for a directions hearing before Moore J on 20 December 2007.
