On 10 March 2004 Ms Tan sent offers for the sale of coal from each of the Dartbrook and the Drayton mines. 25 Over the following week Ms Tan attempted to 'finalise' the coal sales contract with National Power but was unable to do so in terms acceptable to Anglo Coal. The fixtures of vessels which conformed to the requirements of the charterparty suggest the figures for which Mrs Richards and Mr Lewis contend. Hyundai MM seeks damages for the breach. Dartbrook is entitled to be indemnified in accordance with cl 12.1 of the sales representative agreement.
