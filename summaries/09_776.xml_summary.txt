On 29 April 2008, the applicant, Mrs Maria Goyan, issued an application against the respondent in the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia, seeking two orders. Instead of asking the Court to go behind the judgments in the defamation action, the applicant and her husband were contending that they had a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand within s 40(1)(g) of the Act. I will identify these arguments. Mr Goyan swore an affidavit on 15 January 2009. The USFA responded in a letter dated 30 March 1999 written by Dr Motyka in Ukrainian (the 30 March letter).
