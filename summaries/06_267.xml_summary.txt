Nevertheless it would defy reality to postulate that the objections to income tax assessments for the time being unresolved by the Commissioner related to circumstances different in material respects to those falling for resolution by the earlier concluded Spassked. The issue raised by the taxpayer applicants concerning privies would not relate to the issues arising in respect of the 1994 fiscal year, neither IEF and QTH having apparently taken any assignment of losses incurred by Spassked in relation to that year. I will refer to those earlier proceedings at first instance and on appeal as the 'earlier concluded Spassked proceedings'.
