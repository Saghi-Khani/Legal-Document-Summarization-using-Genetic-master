Before me is an application by the Defendant (the First Applicant) for an order pursuant to O 35, r 7(2)(a) of the Federal Court Rules for an order setting aside the winding up order. But I am satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order terminating the winding up of the Defendant. Gyrro Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1477 (11 December 2009) All that Hodgson J required was evidence which "indicates" solvency. Section 482(2) provides that an application may be made by the liquidator, a creditor or a contributory to the company.
