The Applicant provides a platform for approximately 250 Premium SMS services on the Telstra network. The level of complaints continued, culminating in Telstra terminating the 2006 Agreement by a letter dated 12 February 2009. Reliance is also placed upon implied terms. A representation of good faith, if made, may provide a case where it is appropriate at an interlocutory hearing to draw such an inference. To proceed under clause 16.4(f) may, of course, prove more difficult for Telstra. Whether or not the claims founded upon s 52 may ultimately prevail will be resolved at a final hearing.
