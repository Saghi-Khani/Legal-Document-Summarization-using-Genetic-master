Section 49(b) provides that the court determining compensation in accordance with Div 5 must take into account any compensation awarded under Commonwealth, State or Territory law for essentially the same act. In these circumstances, the Commonwealth submits that a determination should be made that no native title rights and interests exist in relation to the Application Area. 15 Section 51 is headed 'Criteria for determining compensation'. Section 13(2) is within Div 1 of Part 2 of the NT Act. Section 48 therefore appears to equate an entitlement to compensation created by Divs 2 and 2B with 'compensation payable'.
