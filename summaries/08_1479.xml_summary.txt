Fesl v Delegate of the Native Title Registrar (No 2) [2008] FCA 1479 (2 October 2008) 16 In the circumstances of that case, Mansfield J considered that costs should nonetheless follow the event. 22 I accept that the judicial review proceeding, although not under the Native Title Act , did involve a construction of important provisions of that Act relating to ILUAs. The Applicants had correctly identified QWI as a necessary respondent party in the proceedings. 12 What then of s 85A the Native Title Act ? That does not mean, in my opinion, that the two Full Court decisions are irreconcilable.
