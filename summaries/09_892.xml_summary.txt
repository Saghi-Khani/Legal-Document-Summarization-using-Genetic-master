On the evidence before the Tribunal, the claimed circumstances of the Applicant's father's death are concocted. The second answer to the appellant's submission is that the Tribunal member did address the ultimate questions of whether the appellant faced or faces significant relevant harm from Muslim fundamentalists in his community and whether he faced a real chance of persecution in Egypt (see [19] and [22]). The Tribunal member made findings about a number of matters. The appellant made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court for constitutional writs directed to the Tribunal.
