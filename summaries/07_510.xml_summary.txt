Arrive Wealth Management now seeks an order that Ms Manning pay its costs (AMP Service's costs cannot be covered because it failed on its causes of action) on a party and party basis, with no reduction pursuant to O 62, r 36A. Indeed, if Arrive Wealth Management's money claim had been kept within reasonable bounds it is likely that the case would have been compromised. I am still minded to take that course notwithstanding the strong submissions made by the plaintiffs that Ms Harkness should only recover costs on a party and party basis.
