In 2007 Mr Brian Culley was prohibited, by decision of a delegate of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ("ASIC"), from managing a corporation for a period of two years. The two relevant companies for the purposes of s 206F(1)(a) were Resources and Special Projects. A second liquidator's report was provided on 26 September 2006. In the present case the Tribunal had found that Resources, Special Projects and Associates were related companies. The disqualification decision was made by the delegate and affirmed by the Tribunal. Question 4 should be answered: "no". Mr Culley appealed to the Tribunal.
