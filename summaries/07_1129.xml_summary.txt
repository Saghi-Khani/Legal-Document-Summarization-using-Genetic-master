27 The Magistrate relied on the GSM letter in answering the appellant's case on the respondent's delay between service of the bankruptcy notice (9 April 2005) and the application to set aside the default judgment (25 May 2005). As the Magistrate said, the proceedings before her were conducted as a hearing de novo upon the same affidavit material and written submissions as were before the Registrar. The appellant appeals from those orders. I will remit the matter to the Federal Magistrates Court for further hearing. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion.
