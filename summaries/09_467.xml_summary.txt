The second applicant (Mr Small) claims he held 1000 B class ordinary shares in PFL Properties. These reasons deal only with the respondents' motion to transfer the proceeding to the Victoria District Registry. An order is sought setting aside the share issue. They point to the fact that the applicants make their case, if at all, on the basis of documentary evidence and argument. Mr Wallis says in late 1992 he had reason to review the share register of PFL. Nevertheless, it is accepted that it is likely that Mr Wallis would be required to give evidence.
