Allphones put Mr Lloyd forward to Tamberlin J as a person who was giving evidence of its case on its behalf and with its authority. It follows that Mr Lloyd's affidavit is capable of being a previous representation and thus capable of falling within the meaning of 'admission' as a matter of law. Of course, the Act applies a particular standard of proof depending on whether the proceedings are civil or criminal and in that way the application of the Act may affect substantive rights. It did not matter that the admission had been made before the first trial.
