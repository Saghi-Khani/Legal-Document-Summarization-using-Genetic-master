Mr Cartan and Ms Cooley (the fourth respondent) ceased any involvement with the applicant in December 2007. Preliminary discovery cannot itself be used to remedy deficiencies in the satisfaction of the conditions themselves; (c) the test for determining whether the applicant has "reasonable cause to believe", as required by subpara (a), is an objective one. It follows that I am not prepared to make an order pursuant to O 15A r 6 in terms sought by the applicant. The only evidence before the Court is that inquiries were made by the applicant of the fifth respondent, Mr Walsh.
