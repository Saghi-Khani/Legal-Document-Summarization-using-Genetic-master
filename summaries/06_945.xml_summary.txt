10 When the matter came before Lloyd-Jones FM, Ms Samootin raised a number of issues. As I understand McHugh J, he made that comment because he thought the application for special leave to appeal against the 3 June 2004 decision merely sought to canvass findings of fact. Ms Samootin was also unsuccessful in having the Court of Appeal stay the costs order. Both respondents are solicitors. 19 The Court will order that the appeal be dismissed with costs. On 1 August 2003, his Honour delivered a judgment which indicated there was no case against the current respondents.
