31 Forestry Tasmania has produced drafts of Mr Meggs' affidavit which are now exhibits in the proceeding. 12 Section 118(a) of the Evidence Act , when read together with O 33 r 11(5) of the Rules of the Court, prevents the production of documents if the production would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between the client and a lawyer, for the dominant purpose of the lawyer providing legal advice to the client. Premature objection? Does s 119 apply? Counsel for Forestry Tasmania resisted that call. Premature objection? Privilege at common law or under the Evidence Act ?
