Mr Mackey said he was not, at that time, carrying out any work on aircraft ONC. He knew that Reg-Air and Mr Hobson did not hold certificates of approval authorising either to issue maintenance releases. Mr Hobson also noted that Mr Pitt of AirAg had borrowed the nose gear doors from aircraft ONC with Mr Harper's permission. For these reasons I do not accept Mr Harper's claims based on the alleged implied representation. Mr Hobson denied each of these conversations. This is the trim servo motor from aircraft ONC.
