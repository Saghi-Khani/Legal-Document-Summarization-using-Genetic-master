Kooee further contends that no special circumstances apply to avoid the conclusion that it was unreasonable for Primus to have refrained from raising its current claims in the earlier proceeding. 20 Primus accepts that the New South Wales proceedings (being the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal matters) determined the parties' rights under the Separation Deed. Kooee denied liability. These two factors were described by Kenny JA in Gibbs v Kinna at [23] as "...necessary but not sufficient considerations for the application of the principle...". The respondent's motion of 3 March 2008 is dismissed.
