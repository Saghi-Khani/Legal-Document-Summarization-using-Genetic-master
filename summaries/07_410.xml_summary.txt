1 A question has arisen whether legal professional privilege has been waived by the University of Western Australia (the University), which is the applicant in these proceedings, in relation to advice received by it before it commenced the present action. 6 In [14] and [15] of Professor Robson's affidavit of 2 March 2007 as filed there was a reference to legal advice received from senior counsel. But it was not read in evidence and cannot be relied upon as supporting a waiver. It also relies, in its plea, upon representations by Dr Gray called the Non-Disclosure Representations.
