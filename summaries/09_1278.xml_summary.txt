My reasons are as follows. When the matter was called for hearing this morning Ms Dinihan, solicitor, appeared for the Minister but there was no appearance for the appellant. Second, and insofar as may be relevant, I have read the notice of appeal, the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court and the first respondent's outline of submissions. The Minister seeks a fixed costs order in the amount of $2,224.00, relying on an affidavit of Ms Dinihan sworn 4 November 2009. There has been no proper explanation provided by the appellant for his failure to attend the hearing.
