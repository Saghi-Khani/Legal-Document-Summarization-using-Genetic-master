13 Mr Cox points out that research by Professor Burton and/or his associates was reported in laboratory books. Gray Meeting means any meeting/s between Dr Gray or any representative of CRI and any staff or partners of Wray and Associates between 21 December 1994 and 23 December 1996. I will give leave to issue a subpoena in a revised form dependant upon suitably narrowed definitions of the terms 'Chen Meeting', 'Gray Meeting' and 'Technology'. All patent attorneys' day book entries, file notes, memoranda, advices, patent specifications (including drafts), correspondence or other documentation relating to the Technology.
