12 Mr Harris' evidence is that Hardel Holdings did not receive any demand for payment from Allmark in respect of alleged outstanding management fees until September 2007. THE CONTEXT  7 The background evidence establishes for present purposes that a Hardel group company --- which Hardel Holdings contends was Stanhope Apartments Pty Ltd --- and Allmark entered into a joint venture agreement, the venture involving the development of property at Kew in Melbourne. I acceded to Mr Harris' request. Mr Riggs said it was his understanding that the scaffolding would be supplied once Hardel Holdings paid Allmark the $90,000 it owed.
