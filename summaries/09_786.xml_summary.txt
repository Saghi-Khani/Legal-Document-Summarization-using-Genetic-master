Issue 7 By reason of the application of the Workplace Expansion Agreement to work undertaken by John Holland employees at the X50 work site, Mr Bradley, Mr Lowth, Mr Robinson and Mr Ong did not have a valid right of entry to the X50 work site on 19 November 2008, 13 February 2009 or 5 March 2009. Mr Hatcher: Yes. Appendix 1 defines the scope of works "for X25" and "for X30". Each notice relied upon ss 738 and 760 of the Act. So we still had access to try and enter into an agreement for X50.
