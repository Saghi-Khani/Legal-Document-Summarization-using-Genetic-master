Both parties accept that Ms Richards is entitled to hold 95 of the 100 issued shares and Ms Arnold is entitled to hold 5 of the 100 issued shares. The demand did not refer to the fact that Mr Armenti had already, without Ms Arnold's authority, changed the register. 16 In a letter dated 31 January 2008 to Ms Richards' solicitors, Ms Arnold's solicitor stated that Ms Arnold was the "sole director and shareholder of the company". 8 On 13 March 2008, Ms Arnold filed a notice of motion applying for the originating application to be dismissed.
