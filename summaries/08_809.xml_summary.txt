On the basis of this evidence, Cussons says that any prima facie case which Unilever may be able to raise is very weak and is insufficient to support its claims. The cross-claim relates to two of Unilever's laundry liquid wash products, namely, Omo Small & Mighty and "Surf Small & Mighty". Accordingly, Cussons claims that the representations are misleading. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE  15 The parties also addressed submissions to the balance of convenience in granting or refusing interlocutory relief. That evidence draws heavily on different scientific tests conducted on Radiant micro Max and Omo Small & Mighty.
