On 16 July 2009, the Applicant provided the Consent Orders and Notice of Discontinuance to Clayton Utz (Clayton Utz), solicitors for the Intervener. In any event, apart from Order 6 r 2(a), Order 6 r 2(b) gives the Court discretion to join an applicant. This would be the case whether there was a joinder or fresh proceedings. The Commissioner intervened pursuant to s 71 of the BCII Act in October 2009. I refused leave to those respective respondents to be heard on the motion. The respondents did not submit otherwise. They are those who entered an appearance.
