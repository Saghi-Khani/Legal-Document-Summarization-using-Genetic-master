He stated that he had had a disability at the time; however, he did not identify the disability. CONCLUSION  66 Because of the lack of adequate explanation for the applicant's delay in filing the application, and the absence of merit in the substantive case of the applicant, I am not satisfied that it would be proper to grant further time in accordance with s 46PO(2) HREOC Act for the applicant to make an application alleging unlawful discrimination by the respondent. THE COURT ORDERS THAT:   1. The Notice of Motion filed on 26 April 2006 be dismissed.
