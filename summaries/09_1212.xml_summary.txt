There should also be a direction that the liquidators of EBD are justified in entering into the Settlement Deed. For all these reasons the compromise constituted by the Settlement Deed should be approved pursuant to s 477(2A) of the Act. As it has no funding to pursue this claim it has applied to the Court for a pre-emptive costs order to be paid out of the money which would otherwise be distributed to EBM's creditors. The plaintiffs are the liquidators of Emu Brewery Developments Pty Ltd (EBD), appointed by a creditors' resolution. That application was part heard.
