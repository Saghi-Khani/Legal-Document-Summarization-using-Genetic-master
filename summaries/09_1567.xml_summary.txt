The immediately material matter is that the Trade Marks Act provides that the applicant may bring an action for infringement of a notified trade mark in respect of the goods the subject of the notice and give notice to the CEO of that action in writing within a period of 10 working days from 23 October 2009, or, if the Chief Executive Officer extends the period under s 137(1) of the Trade Marks Act , within the extended period. Having regard to that matter, I am satisfied that an injunction order ought to be made directed to the first respondent.
