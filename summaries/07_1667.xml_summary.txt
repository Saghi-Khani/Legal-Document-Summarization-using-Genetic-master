On judicial review, the Federal Magistrates Court is limited to assessing whether or not there was jurisdictional error. 3 The Tribunal, in considering that question, applied the law as it was understood at that time which was prior to the decisions of the High Court in SZATV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 237 ALR 634 and S ZFDV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 237 ALR 660. 4 The appellants, although not having framed any ground of appeal, referred me to some writings on relocation which, again, are based upon Randhawa 52 FCR 437.
