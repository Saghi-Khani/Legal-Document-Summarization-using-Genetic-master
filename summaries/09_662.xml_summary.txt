Such income was not 'income derived by the bankrupt' within the meaning of s 139W BA. Nor does the analysis alter by reason of the fact of the number of persons employed by the employer company to provide income generating work. The only live issue before the Tribunal related to the determination of the Inspector-General that ten elevenths of the net income of the Company was assessable income of Mr McGushin by virtue of s 139L(1)(a)(vii) BA. Mr McGushin's shares in the Company should have vested in the trustee in bankruptcy when he became bankrupt.
