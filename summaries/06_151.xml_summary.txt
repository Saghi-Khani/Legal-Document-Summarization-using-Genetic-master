1 On 21 October 2005 I dealt with one aspect of a motion by Aaron Stephenson for access to subpoenaed documents for the purpose of use in other proceedings and for related relief. The value of the implied undertaking would be diminished if these orders are granted, particularly as use in breach has already occurred. 3 Stephenson is the applicant in proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) against APRA appealing against APRA's decision to disqualify him under s 25A of the Insurance Act 1973 . Rural & General was represented by solicitors and counsel and actively opposed the winding up.
