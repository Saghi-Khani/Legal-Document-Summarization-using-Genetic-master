Firstly, the appellant's particular social group claim was a separate claim, not merely an additional "evidentiary" limb of the claim of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of political opinion. The Tribunal does not accept that the applicant was a leader or a high level BNP activist with any significant political profile. In a completely repressed state, there will be no political activity. At this time, the Awami League was in government in Bangladesh. As such we believe the applicant will be persecuted upon returning to Bangladesh. That candidate was elected.
