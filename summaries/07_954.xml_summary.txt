Mr Bingham was also claimed to have said that they were the best interest rates he would be able to give to the applicants. However, ASS has not sought to plead that it owed any fiduciary duties to the bank. That material included a letter of 4 February 1997 from Akyman to the bank which Mr Sukkar said was handed to him in about March 1997. ASS pointed to pars 55 and 56 of the amended statement of claim. But those allegations appear to be ones involving activity by Akyman, not by ASS. 8 Negotiations then proceeded between the parties.
