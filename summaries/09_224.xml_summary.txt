The AWU's motion was not incompetent. I thus made the finding recorded in [3] above. The AWU called evidence from Mr Tocchet about Mr O'Connor's actions at the mine on 10 November 2005. (4) During the hearing on 15 to 17 September 2008 the applicant called evidence from Mr Rosenblatt and Mr Smits about Mr O'Connor's actions at the Lake Cowal gold mine on 10 November 2005. Accordingly, s 824 precludes the making of a costs order. The documents were inconclusive. Alfred v Wakelin (No 3) [2009] FCA 224 (13 March 2009)
