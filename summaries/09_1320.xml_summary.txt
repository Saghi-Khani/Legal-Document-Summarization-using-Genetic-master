In its present further amended form, the contravention with which it is concerned is that alleged in para 27. Materially, condition 3 attached to the approval given by the Minister under that Act required Burnett Water at all material times to: install a fish transfer device on the dam suitable for the lungfish; and commence the fishway when the dam became operational. I therefore reject the tender of Mr Tait's report. There is also the vice elsewhere evident in the report, insofar as it may be relevant, of not making plain what is fact and what is opinion.
