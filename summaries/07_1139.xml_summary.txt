It does so because it is a mortgagee of the ship: see Bank of Kuwait and the Middle East v The Ship MV "Mawashi Al Gasseem" (No 2) [2007] FCA 815. I also ordered that the costs of the plaintiff in relation to that claim be paid out of the bunker account. Judgment was entered in that action for US$639,379.60 with interest by Finn J on 26 July 2005. Those amounts were paid from the ship account. The conversions should also be made two days before payment out for the purposes of the pro rata calculation.
