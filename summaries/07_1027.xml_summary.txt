8 The native title party also provided to the Tribunal a copy of BHP's "Aboriginal Heritage Induction Handbook" which referred to the Barimunya site. The appellants said that the Tribunal made no express finding as to the nature of the activities that would constitute interference with the site under s 237(b) of the Act. 7 The confidential witness statements of Mr Slim Parker and Mr Tim Parker set out the reasons why the Barimunya site has special significance to the native title party. 25 Accordingly, in my view, the second and third grounds of appeal should be dismissed.
