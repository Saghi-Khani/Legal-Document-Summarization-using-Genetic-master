The Federal Magistrate considered the appellant's claims, as particularised by the appellant in his application for judicial review, and found that the Tribunal had considered but rejected the appellant's claim. Her Honour found that these inconsistencies were information for the purposes of s 424A(1) and that these inconsistencies had formed part of the reason for the Tribunal rejecting the appellant's credibility. CONCLUSION  24 Accordingly, I find no error in her Honour's decision and dismiss the appeal. Much of his evidence was implausible and unconvincing. In one respect the documents made fresh claims.
