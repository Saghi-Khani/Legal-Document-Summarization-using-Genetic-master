The application was rejected because it was, at relevant times, a requirement that applicants for the grant of Australian citizenship be permanent residents of Australia: see s 13(1)(a) of the Act. 4 The records disclose that the applicant first came to Australia on a tourist visa in 2000. Any appeal against the Tribunal's decision would, however, be bound to fail. 2 The Court does not have before it the Tribunal's file. It was accompanied by an affidavit which the applicant had sworn on 11 January 2008 and a notice of appeal, also dated 11 January 2008.
