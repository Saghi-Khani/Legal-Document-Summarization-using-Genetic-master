MONEY AS GOODS  The Fijian currency supplied to Mr Urquhart pursuant to the Fijian Currency Transaction consisted of bank notes issued by the Reserve Bank of Fiji. There was a financial supply. That is to say, item 4 is concerned with a supply in relation to a right that could be the subject of creation, grant, transfer, assignment or surrender by Travelex. They were money within the meaning of s 195-1 of the GST Act. However, s 38-185 may also have some bearing on the question.
