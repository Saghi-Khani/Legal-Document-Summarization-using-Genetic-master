Paragraph 9 of the Statement of Claim gives particulars of a conversation between Mr Livoni and one or more of the Audit Team. 38 The Applicant objects to the requests relating to para 14 on the grounds that they are not proper requests for particulars but are more in the nature of interrogatories. Therefore the Respondent seeks particulars of the facts upon which the allegation is based. Order 12 r 3 provides:  '(1) A party pleading any condition of mind shall give particulars of the facts on which he relies.
