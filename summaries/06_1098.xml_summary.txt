On 19 June 2006 I ordered pursuant to s 411(1) of the Act that separate meetings of the members and option holders of Rocksoft be convened for the purpose of considering, and if thought fit, agreeing to the scheme. I gave that approval by orders made on 25 July 2006. In no instance will either of them receive more per share or per option than other members or option holders in Rocksoft. There is no modification to the rights of shareholders or creditors' entitlements by the scheme. The option holders also voted strongly in favour of the scheme.
