The payment was made following the termination of his employment by Deutsche Australia upon his redundancy. 34 The Tribunal considered that the definition of exempt non-resident foreign termination payment in s 27A required that the relevant payment must relate solely to a period of the employment during which a taxpayer was a non-resident of Australia. The payment made on 1 May was paid by reference to 14 months' salary. 15 On 12 December 2002, the Taxpayer's solicitors responded to the letter of 9 December 2002. However, there was no finding to that effect by the Tribunal.
