This information included the fact that the Tribunal considered that the claims made by the appellant and her sister were relevantly similar. The appellant cited the Tribunal's reference to a "kindly guard" as an exaggeration of her evidence, which might lead a fair-minded observer to conclude that the Tribunal might not have brought an impartial mind to her case. Nor did this argument support the appellant's apprehended bias claim. The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision on 23 March 2009. I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow. I would reject this contention.
