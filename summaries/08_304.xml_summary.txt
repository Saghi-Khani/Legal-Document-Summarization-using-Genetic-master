The letter noted the legal action by Energizer, as well as the order requiring the fixing of a new sticker on all stock leaving Remington's warehouse as of 23 January 2008 and then stated:  The Court did not make any orders restraining any retailer (including Coles) from selling Varta HIGH ENERGY batteries that have the old sticker on them. 5 The interlocutory hearing commenced on 7 December 2007. Relief sought -supplemental order? No such orders were made. MR HUTLEY: If your Honour pleases. Remington has updated this evidence. Coles was not a party to those proceedings.
