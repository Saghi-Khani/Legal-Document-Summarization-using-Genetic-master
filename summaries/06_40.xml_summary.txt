The husband claimed to fear persecution by reason of his actual or imputed political opinion. 1 The present proceeding is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court ('FMC') of 17 August 2005 dismissing the appellants' applications for review on the basis of Anshun estoppel. The procedural fairness ground of review now agitated by the appellants was a ground that was open to be raised, but was not raised, at the hearing before Marshall J. On 23 November 2001, the first appellant (the husband) filed an application in the Court seeking judicial review of the RRT's decision.
