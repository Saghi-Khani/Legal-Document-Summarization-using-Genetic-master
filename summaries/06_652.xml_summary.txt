APPLICATION TO DISCHARGE INTERLOCUTORY ORDERS  4 The first issue which arises concerns the application to discharge the injunctive order made on 19 May 2006. Under that rule, a motion seeking leave to appeal must be filed within seven days after the date on which the interlocutory judgment was pronounced. Paras v Public Service Body Head of the Department of Infrastructure (No 2) [2006] FCA 652 (26 May 2006) I therefore decline to grant any such a stay. The affidavits do not raise any new issue or newly discovered facts or disclose any circumstances that have changed since 19 May 2006.
