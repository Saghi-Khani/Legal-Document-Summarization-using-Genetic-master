NSI says that commercial confidence was never claimed by the University in relation to any of the information included in the NFA application either at the time that the NFA application was made or subsequently. Dr Holt's evidence was that the phosphopeptides would stabilise the amorphous calcium phosphate in a soluble alkaline form. The same process occurs if the whole protein is used. It is asserted by NSI that this article discloses the invention of Claim 7. By 1993, Calpep comprised not only the phosphopeptides with the Cluster Sequence but also those phosphopeptides in a complex with calcium phosphate.
