The first respondent is the manufacturer of the Guardliner barrier system. Dr Jenkins does express the view that:   ... the metal pipes as shown in the Wasserstrom Patent do overlie the side walls of the barrier elements. The forced distributing means is secured to the frame structure and extends substantially horizontally and parallel to the associated highway barrier and the road surface on which the highway barrier is arranged. Again I disagree. Claim 1 is set out above, in [6]. Therefore each guardrail unit overlies at least two barrier element side walls. This only requires connection to the side wall.
