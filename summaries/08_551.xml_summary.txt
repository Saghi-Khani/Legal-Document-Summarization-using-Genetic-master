BHPB Freight Pty Ltd v Cosco Oceania Chartering Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 551 (23 April 2008) The stay application was based on s 7 of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) and, in the alternative, on the court's inherent jurisdiction. In their joint judgment they said (at 548):  An agreement to refer disputes, whether existing or future, to arbitration could, apart from statute, be enforced only by an action for damages against the party who refused to carry it out. It also sought to restrain Cosco from taking any further steps in the arbitration (the anti-arbitration injunction).
