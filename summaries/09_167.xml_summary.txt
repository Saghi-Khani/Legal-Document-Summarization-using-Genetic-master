THE TRIBUNAL  The Tribunal accepted that the bus stop incident of 12 August 2003 occurred as the appellant claimed. Section 424AA(b)(iv) operates where the Tribunal orally gives an appellant particulars of information it considers would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision under review. Firstly, that the Tribunal failed to follow proper procedure at the time of the hearing. The second ground before the Court below had two parts. The Federal Magistrate correctly found that this section does not impose a mandatory obligation on the Tribunal.
