The result of the appeal  12 The appellant has not identified any ground on which the Federal Magistrates Court could have held that the Tribunal's decision should be set aside and that the application for review of the Minister's delegate's decision refusing to grant a protection visa dealt with again. 8 The Tribunal did not accept the appellant's claims that he had suffered persecution in India. The Tribunal member appears to have thought that he was bound to take the first course. The Tribunal finds that the evidence in relation to his name is inconsistent.
