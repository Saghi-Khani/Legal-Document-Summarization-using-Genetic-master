On 18 July 2005 the Applicant made a claim to the Repatriation Commission ("Commission") via the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the acceptance of post-traumatic stress disorder as a war-caused injury or disease. There was before the tribunal evidence from appropriately qualified medical specialists, both of whom used DSM-IV as the appropriate framework for making a diagnosis. On 11 December 2007, for reasons that it then published, the Tribunal, constituted by Mr Kenny, Member, affirmed the decision under review. On the facts before it, the Tribunal reached a different view in relation to that particular criterion.
