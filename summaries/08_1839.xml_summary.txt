1 On 29 September 2008 I made orders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) convening three meetings to be held for the purpose of considering schemes of arrangement relating to a proposed merger between the plaintiff ("St George") and Westpac Banking Corporation ("Westpac"). 3 Full details of the Share Scheme, the SAINTS Scheme and the Options Scheme were contained in helpful written submissions which were provided to me by Senior Counsel for St George, Mr Jackman SC, prior to the first court hearing on 29 September 2008.
