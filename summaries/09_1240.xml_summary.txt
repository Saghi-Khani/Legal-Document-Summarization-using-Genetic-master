The separate question In this case a separate question was formulated under Part 17 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 in relation to the validity of a declaration of trust by the first respondent to the present application, Mr Boensch, who was made bankrupt on 23 August 2005, which declared a trust over a property at 255 Victoria Road Rydalmere for the benefit of his children, Dominic and Stefanie. The application for leave to appeal was granted and the appeal was allowed in part. There may ... by amendment, be a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting or defending that proceeding.
