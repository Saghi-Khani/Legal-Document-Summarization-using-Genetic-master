The District Court judgment was entered on 26 October 2006. HIS HONOUR: And notwithstanding the appeal the matter is proceeding. It was claimed that the notices overstated the amount due by $10,000. 15 The appeal against the sequestration order contains three grounds. Mrs Perovich swore an affidavit in support of the application and gave oral evidence before the Federal Magistrate. No finding of credit was made against the respondent. This was not a case where the creditor had obtained a summary default judgment. I need some more time. In calculating this sum the respondent's solicitor had included interest.
