2 There are three styles of footwear sold by the first respondent (YD) in relation to which Diesel alleges trade mark infringement: the Photon shoe, the Cube shoe and the Gamon shoe. Mr Vickery described the rounded piece as "quite distinctive" and not a feature commonly used in the shoe industry. BACKGROUND  1 The second applicant (Diesel) is the registered owner of two trade marks under the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) (the Act). The pattern on the sole is different (dimples). It was an applicant. The Cube shoe is not substantially identical to the Shape Mark.
