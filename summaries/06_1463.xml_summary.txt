The applicant, therefore, should have brought her proceedings within 28 days of 1 December 2005. That may not, having regard to her status, be of itself enough to refuse the application for leave to file and serve a notice of appeal outside the time prescribed in O 52 r 15. 8 The applicant took no action in relation to the RRT's decision until, on 18 April 2006, she applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for a review of the RRT's decision made on 7 June 2004. She was divorced in June 2003. 21 The application is therefore dismissed.
