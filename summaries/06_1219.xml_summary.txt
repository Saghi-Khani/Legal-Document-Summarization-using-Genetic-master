There is reasonable cause to believe that Mr Merrigan and Mr Thurlow are likely to have in their possession documents, including email communications and copies of the Austal Report, relevant to the question whether Austal has a right to obtain relief against them. In May 2006 Mr Steven Thurlow, a Marketing Consultant employed by Incat Europe Ltd, sent an email to a Norwegian company called Master Ferries which attached a confidential, in-house report prepared by Austal. Mr Thurlow's business card was exhibited to the affidavit of Matthew Holgate, a legal practitioner acting for the Austal Group.
