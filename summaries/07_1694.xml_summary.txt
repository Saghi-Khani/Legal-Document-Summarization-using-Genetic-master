Brother Industries, Ltd v Dynamic Supplies Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1694 (9 November 2007) Brother submits that the case was not solely about packaging but also involved considerations of infringement and misleading conduct in relation to printer drum units to which Brother's registered Australian trade marks had been wrongly applied. 2 I have now received submissions from the parties in relation to the form of the orders. 4 Dynamic Supplies submit that Brother's proposed order 3 is broader than the Court's reasons, which related to the counterfeit packaging in which certain products manufactured by Brother were packaged.
