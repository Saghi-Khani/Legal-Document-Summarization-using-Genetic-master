The Tribunal has duly considered material such as the 2 June 2006 medical report and the Jesus Family Centre's social worker's statement but finds that it cannot give these such weight as can help resolve the Applicant's credibility problems in relation to her claims about abuse in Nepal (AB304). The appellant contended that her husband had been killed in a clash between Maoist activists and the Nepalese army. The appellant also gave oral evidence at the first Tribunal hearing. The case also concerned events in Nepal. The appellant was represented. She says the appellant may commit suicide.
