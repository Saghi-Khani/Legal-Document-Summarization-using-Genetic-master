They applied in April 2008 for an order that they proceed to make the distribution of funds to EBM's unsecured creditors in accordance with a Notice of Intention to Declare a Second Dividend (Notice) dated 4 March 2008. In the event that the proceedings continue and the defendant succeeds in its claim, there will be no further funds available for the liquidators to distribute, and the creditors will therefore not receive any further dividend. However a settlement has been agreed between EBM and EBD. The plaintiffs are the joint and several liquidators of Emu Brewery Mezzanine Limited (EBM).
