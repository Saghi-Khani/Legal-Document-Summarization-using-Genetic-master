1 This is an appeal from a Federal Magistrate's decision, handed down on 7 March 2005, dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') delivered on 4 December 2003: see MZWCY & Anor v Minister for Immigration [2005] FMCA 390. The first 'finding' is rather a step in the process of reasoning that led the Tribunal to determine that the husband was not, as he claimed, a member of a peace committee.
