Before he came to Australia to visit, the appellant received a letter sent from Centrelink dated 5 April 2004 which provided:   Social Security and Family Assistance legislation will change from 1 July 2004. If I am wrong and the advice given to the appellant was incorrect, the respondent is not estopped from refusing to determine that the appellant's maximum portability period for disability support pension is for an unlimited period, where the Act now limits the portability period for disability support pension to 13 weeks. The appellant now appeals from the decision of the Tribunal.
