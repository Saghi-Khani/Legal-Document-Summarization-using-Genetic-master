It should be noted, however, that even without the release of MCA from its debt owed to SC, MCA would still be solvent. It follows that MCA became disqualified from holding office as trustee of the Trust upon its going into voluntary liquidation on 17 April 2009. In any event, in his affidavit made on 12 May 2009 Mr Den Boer undertakes to ensure that the Liquidators' costs and expenses are paid. The total of the unit holders' loan account balances, however, remains $443,109. Until the winding up is terminated, MCA remains disqualified.
