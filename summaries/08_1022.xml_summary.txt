Section 137(1), for example, makes it quite clear that an action for infringement must be brought within the 10-day period specified in the notice or with any extended period granted by the Customs Chief Executive Officer, provided the objector has applied for an extension "before the end of the notified period". Part 13 serves a very particular purpose, but it is not in any way exhaustive of the circumstances in which an infringement application may be brought in this court. The notice given by the Customs to Jemella Australia is dated in each instance 20 April 2008.
