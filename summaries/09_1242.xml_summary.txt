MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE CONDUCT CLAIM  The competing submissions  The applicants' primary case for breach of s 42 of the Fair Trading Act is that Mr Schultz's written direction to Willowdene and oral direction to Transfield on 24 March 2004 represented to each that he, as the Principal's Representative, reasonably regarded CPR Property as unsuitable such as to warrant CPR Property being prohibited from carrying out work on the Department's properties. It knew that Mr Fordham was investigating all of the allegations against AB. I accept Mr Hine's evidence. An order for costs also must be made.
