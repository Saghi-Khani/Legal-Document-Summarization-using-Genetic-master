1 By notice of motion dated 2 October 2006, the first, second and third respondents have applied for an order restraining Wakefield & Vogrig Lawyers ('WVL') from acting for the first applicant, Geelong School Supplies Pty Ltd ('GSS'), in these proceedings. In Bowen v Stott , Hasluck J confronted a similar situation. However, counsel for the Deans foreshadowed that the claim would be raised in these proceedings. In their letter, HAL denied the allegations against their client. From whom would WVL take instructions? One share is held by Russell Porch, a director of Landmark, in trust for Landmark.
