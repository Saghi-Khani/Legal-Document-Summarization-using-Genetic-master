(b) Declares pursuant to ss 30 and 222 (8) of the Bankruptcy Act that the property described in the First Schedule hereto is held on trust by the first respondent for those persons who were creditors of the Naylor Estates as at 11 May 2007. As I said in my earlier reasons, the Parliament intended that unnecessary applications to the Court be eliminated. The parties should pay their own costs from 15 August 2007 to today. The applicants have submitted themselves to an undertaking to the Court. (f) Sixthly, I considered ordering only one meeting in order 3(c)(i).
