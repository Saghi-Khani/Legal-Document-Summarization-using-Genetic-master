One of the claims was that those actions constituted the tort in Wilkinson v Downton . Paragraph 51 alleges that the conduct of the Commonwealth involved a breach of a fiduciary duty alleged to be owed to Mr Habib. However, Mr Hicks' and Mr Habib's cases are conceptually very different. Conclusion The pleading must be struck out. However, I would not regard the act of State doctrine as necessarily applicable to a claim based on misfeasance in a public office. No such cause of action should be permitted to proceed. The duty alleged in the proposed pleading is somewhat different.
