The Taxpayer argues that the amount of $95,293,880 is deductible in the relevant year under subsection 8-1(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (''the ITAA 1997"). Included in the calculation of that loss was Amayana's claim to deduct as bad debts written-off the interest owed to Amayana by EFGA.
