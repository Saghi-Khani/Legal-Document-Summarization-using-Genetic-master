MISLEADING CONDUCT  The applicants' next apprehended concern relates to an email which the respondent has sent to individual employees. However, in mid-June the negotiations broke down and the respondent announced that it would seek the approval of the employees for a non-union collective agreement. That will only occur after the collective agreement is lodged pursuant to s 341 of the Act. If the employees approved the proposed collective agreement at the ballot, that approval will not result in the collective agreement immediately coming into effect. The balance of convenience does not favour the grant of the injunction.
