I am satisfied that neither applicant will participate in Falungong-related practice or other activities if they return to China. 45 The first appellant claimed that his Falun Gong practice in Australia commenced some 19 months before his initial application for a protection visa. On 29 July 2002, the second appellant applied to the Tribunal for review of that decision. The learned Federal Magistrates made incorrect findings. That conduct was disregarded, as required by s 91R(3). Therefore the Tribunal has disregarded that conduct in coming to its decision. However, the Tribunal did not accept the appellants' claims.
