I have sought to explain to Mr Cram on more than one of those occasions that his application does not appear to disclose a reasonable cause of action. No final orders have, at this stage, been made by me in this matter. 3 A notice of motion has now been filed by the respondent for the proceeding to be dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) on the basis that the applicant has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding. Cram v Registrar, Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2007] FCA 965 (19 June 2007)
