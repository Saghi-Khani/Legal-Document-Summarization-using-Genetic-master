First, I consider that any employee who is engaged on terms and conditions specified in cll 6.3.3(c), 6.3.3(d) and 6.8 of the PSA is entitled during long service leave to payment of the sum prescribed in each of those clauses in addition to the base rate of pay specified in cl 5.2.1 for each ordinary hour of work. "Ordinary time" is not defined in the State Act. Mr Kayne Packenas is an employee of the respondent at a supermarket distribution centre whose employment is regulated by the PSA.
