2 It is common ground that the plaintiff carried out repair work on the defendant ship, the 'Falcon Trident'. The balance of the agreed price, namely, the sum of US$233,500, was to be paid by the defendant within 60 days. In my opinion, security for costs should be ordered. Such a case is not articulated in the pleadings. 4 There is no challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court. However, the plaintiff's prospects of success are relevant on an application for security for costs: Gartner v Ernst and Young (No 3) [2003] FCA 1437.
