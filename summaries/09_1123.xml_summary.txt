The application for an order transferring the proceedings to the Supreme Court of Queensland is made pursuant to s 5(4) of the Jurisdiction of Courts (Cross-vesting) Act 1987 (Cth). In support of that order Counsel emphasised the following matters: It seems to me that the most important factor which is to be taken into account in the present case is the cost and inconvenience that will be visited upon the third and fourth respondents if the proceedings remain in the New South Wales District Registry of the Court. The alternative order sought, however, has considerably more merit.
