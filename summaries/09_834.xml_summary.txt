Before the proposed consent orders were signed, the Northern Territory had Emeritus Professor Sansom consider the anthropological reports prepared by Mr Elliott going to the existence of native title. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Court has power to make of the consent determination sought. I congratulate the parties on reaching this agreement. The mere fact that the State was a party may not be sufficient. The applicants and the Northern Territory agree that the materials filed in the Court disclose in detail the laws and customs of the Ilkewartn and Ywel Anmatyerr people.
