I am not satisfied that the Applicant has demonstrated an arguable question of claim group connection on the part of the Brims with the lands the subject of the Application. As to s 203BJ(b), there is no evidence that the CYLC has failed to identify persons who may hold native title in the area the subject of the claim for which the body is the representative body. The Applicants on behalf of the Dingaal claim group included Gordon Charlie and Jonathon Charlie. The Notice of Meeting was issued on or about 17 October 2006 enclosed with a letter.
