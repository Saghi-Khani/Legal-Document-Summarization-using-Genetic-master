The central issue in the strike-out application is whether the Union can make a collateral challenge in these proceedings to the validity of the Minister's declaration made on 31 October 2006 that John Holland was an eligible corporation. It is appropriate, at this point, to set out s 100 of the SRC Act. I therefore reject this submission. Finally, Kirby J appeared to accept that a collateral attack on the validity of a warrant could be mounted in the course of a criminal trial: see Ousley at 146 and footnote 343.
