Mr Nicholls did not appeal from the orders made by Mansfield J on 23 July 2009 within the twenty-one (21) days being the time prescribed for the filing of a notice of appeal by O 52 r 15(1) of the Federal Court Rules . It would appear, from his Honour's reasons, that Mr Nicholls has not cooperated in any way in attempting to identify those documents. The third complaint relates apparently to the cross-examination of Mr Nicholls during the application for the adjournment. Nicholls v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2009] FCA 1003 (25 August 2009)
