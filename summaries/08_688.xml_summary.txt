He had applied to enrol in the course and had been accepted. The Federal Magistrate noted that the report did not indicate that the appellant was suffering PTSD at the time of the report, and did not link the disorder with his failure to study. The Tribunal therefore found that these circumstances did not constitute "exceptional circumstances" that would explain his non-compliance, and it affirmed the decision to cancel the appellant's visa. The report was dated 25 August 2006 and had been provided to the Tribunal. 10 His Honour could find no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.
