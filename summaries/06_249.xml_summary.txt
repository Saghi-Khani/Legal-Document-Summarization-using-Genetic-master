This is an application for leave to appeal from orders of Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones made on 11 November 2005. Once a finding to that effect was made, as was inevitable, the disqualifying time limit under s 477(1A) necessarily applied, and the outcome before the Federal Magistrate's Court was inevitable. In support of the present application, the applicant filed written submissions dated 2 March 2006, which made extensive criticisms of the original decision of the Minister's delegate and thereafter of the Tribunal, being submissions which purported to expose a lack of procedural fairness and natural justice.
