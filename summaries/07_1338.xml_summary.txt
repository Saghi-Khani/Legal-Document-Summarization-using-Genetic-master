25 The appellant's case before the Federal Magistrate was that her protection visa application was no application because it did not comply with Form 866 and because the statutory declaration was signed before the protection visa application was completed. 35 A similar result was reached in NAWZ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 199. 29 Section 47(1) of the relevant Act requires the Minister to consider a valid application for a visa. The Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision. 22 The appellant's notice of appeal was filed in this Court on 3 May 2007.
