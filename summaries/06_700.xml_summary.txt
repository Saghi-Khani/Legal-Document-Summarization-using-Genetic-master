At the time that the respondent conducted himself in breach of Jenkinson J's order and the undertaking given to Kenny J, a warrant was lying in the Court which would issue if a contravention occurred. 9 On 14 May 1999 the applicant sought a further order that the respondent be committed to prison or otherwise punished for contempt for a further breach of the order made by Jenkinson J on 10 March 1992. It is necessary to require Mr Reid to serve a sentence of imprisonment to impress upon him the seriousness of his behaviour. Continually investigated by ASIC.
