The applicant, Eric Preston Pty Ltd, ("EP") asserts a claim of legal professional privilege in respect of an e-mail dated 17 April 2008 sent by Mr Bruce Drummond, one of EP's directors, to Mr Graham Anderson, its accountant (the second e-mail). The language of s 118(a) is directed to prohibiting evidence being adduced that would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between a client and a lawyer. Euroz submits that the second e-mail is not the subject of such privilege, or if it is, that it has been waived. WAS THE PRIVILEGE LOST?
