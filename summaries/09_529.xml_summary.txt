Accordingly, I make an order in terms of paragraph 6, as formulated in the draft order. Order 4 is in these terms:  That the applicants pay the third respondent's costs thrown away by reason of the amendment of the application and the further amendment of the amended statement of claim, assessed on a solicitor-client basis and those costs be payable forthwith. The first is a motion filed on 7 April 2009 and the second is a motion filed on 12 March 2009. Those orders were made with the support of the applicants. Order 7 is not controversial.
