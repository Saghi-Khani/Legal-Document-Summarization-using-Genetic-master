42 In the period between 1 July 2005 and 23 November 2005, there were 24 sales of the Count 5 item. 99 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant made a representation about the price of each of the 11 jewellery items by its publication of the Christmas catalogue. It had a sale price of $169 and a strike through price of $350. There were 10 sales between $600 and $750. 37 During the sale period, there were 241 sales of the Count 4 item. The defendant did not suggest any.
