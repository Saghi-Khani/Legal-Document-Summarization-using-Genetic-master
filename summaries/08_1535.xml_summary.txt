QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED IN THE APPEAL   1.1 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in the methodology it adopted to ascertain whether the applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accepted as a war related disease. The paragraph picks up, by reference, the Tribunal's earlier findings that the events on which Mr Masliczek relied either did not occur or did not occur in the manner described by him. It also considered medical evidence about his claim to be suffering from PTSD. Therefore he does not satisfy the first step.
