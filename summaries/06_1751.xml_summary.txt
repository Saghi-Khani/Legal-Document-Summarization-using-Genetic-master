The relevant decision of the Tribunal was to set aside a determination of the Corporation, made on reconsideration of an earlier determination, that the Corporation had no present liability to pay compensation to Ms Barry under s 16 and s 19 of the SRC Act. Nothing in the reasons for decision of the Tribunal suggests that it gave consideration to whether Ms Barry was incapacitated at the relevant time for work as a result of the injury suffered by her on 20 October 2003. The Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to review the decision made on 17 August 2005.
