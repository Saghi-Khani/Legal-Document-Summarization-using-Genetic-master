In my opinion, a company in which the assets are exceeded by liabilities is not solvent, although it may be able to continue trading because it has excess liquidity for the time being. 1 The order to wind up AFIYF Pty Limited (in liquidation) ACN 074 864 805 (the company) was made on 10 February 2006. As I understand the position, no external creditor appeared on that occasion notwithstanding the usual advertisements and notifications. The application was made on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. That appears sufficiently from the affidavits. 3 The application requires some scrutiny.
