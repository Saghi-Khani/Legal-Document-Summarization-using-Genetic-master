This proceeding raises the question of whether legal expenses incurred in resisting charges made against the Taxpayer under the Public Service Act, alleging improper conduct as an officer and failing to fulfil his duty as an officer, should be allowed as deductions from the Taxpayer's assessable income for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) ('the Assessment Act'). The Applicant's appeal to the Full Federal Court against that decision was dismissed. The evidence of the second and third sets of disciplinary charges include AFP telephone interceptions and AFP covert surveillance records .
