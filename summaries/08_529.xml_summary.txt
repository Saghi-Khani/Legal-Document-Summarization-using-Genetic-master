Section 190A(3) of the Act sets out the material to which the Registrar must have regard when considering a claim under s 190A. â€¢ The applicants wrote an email to the case manager on 17 August 2007 requesting an extension of time to amend the claim and provide further information. As a consequence, the applicants' claim was removed from the Register. Aside from the additional requirements imposed on the Registrar by Item 90, it is important to note that the applicants' claim was already entered onto the Register, thereby conferring upon the applicants the various rights that come with registration.
