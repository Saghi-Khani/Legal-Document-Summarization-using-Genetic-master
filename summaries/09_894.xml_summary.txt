Accordingly, the last paragraph of cl 3.10 of the 2002 agreement has no continued operation or effect under the 2005 agreement. RailCorp did not make any determination with respect to this position within the meaning of cl 22.1 within four weeks of 9 April 2006 (that is, by 7 May 2006). Position 700139 (CSA 2) : This position became vacant on 27 January 2008. Mr Greenhalgh gave some other evidence which I consider relevant. The parties to the 2005 agreement described the clause as relating to the filling of authorised positions, not vacant positions.
