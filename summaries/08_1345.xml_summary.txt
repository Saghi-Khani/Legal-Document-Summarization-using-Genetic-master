On the following day, 13 May 2005, the Tribunal sent a fax to Mr Cook confirming that the directions hearing would proceed on 16 May 2005. By fax received on 23 May 2005, Mr Cook advised that he had been able to arrange for Mr Wearne to give evidence at 2pm on Thursday 23 June 2005, which had indicated that that difficulty had been overcome. It was reasonable for the Tribunal to give him the opportunity of explaining and advancing his application at a phone directions hearing. Rosemarie Cook is still sick. Telephone directions are impractical.
