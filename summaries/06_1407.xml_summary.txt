GenRx resists the injunction and says, amongst other things, that there can be no infringement because the patent is not valid. Adequacy of damages   15 There appeared to be no real issue about whether Merck would suffer damage as a result of GenRx importing into Australia the generic drugs containing AMT for distribution and sale. A claimed salt of alendronic acid in Merck's patent (claim 23) is 4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1, 1-bisphosphonic acid monosodium salt trihydrate ("AMT"). It was granted the patent in 1992.
