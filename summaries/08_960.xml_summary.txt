SFC contends that the purpose of s 824(2) is to make a party liable for costs  'in respect of an unreasonable act or omission in connection with the proceeding instituted in the Court. According to AMOU, SFC conceded at the hearing of 28 May 2008 that its case for interlocutory relief was hopeless. 2 On 29 May 2008, the second respondents filed a motion seeking an anti-suit injunction against SFC. SFC also submits that withdrawing its application for interlocutory relief does not establish that it commenced the application against AMOU without reasonable cause.
