Relevantly, Deane and Gaudron JJ in Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21 ; (1989) 85 ALR 1 at 11 said:  The inherent power of a court to control and supervise proceedings includes the power to take appropriate action to prevent injustice... The subpoena required Ms Chaloner to attend the Federal Court in Brisbane today. Mr Mossman deposed, inter alia , that at no time did he threaten, induce or coerce Ms Chaloner into making an affidavit - rather Ms Chaloner was agreeable to giving the affidavit. Mr Rhys Thomas has subsequently executed his affidavit and it was filed in Court this morning.
