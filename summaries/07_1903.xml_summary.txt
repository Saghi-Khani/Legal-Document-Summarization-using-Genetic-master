BUCHANAN J:  1 Ms Demetrius McDonald was employed by the first respondent ('Parnell Laboratories') with effect from 6 February 2006. Both Ms McDonald and Mr Bell agree that the reason given for termination of employment was dishonesty in a response Ms McDonald gave to Mr Bell in answer to an instruction to state her times of attendance over the previous three weeks. It provided for eight weeks notice in writing of termination of employment 'except in the case of serious, wilful or persistent misconduct'. However, the present is not a case where any principle derived from Amann is readily applied.
