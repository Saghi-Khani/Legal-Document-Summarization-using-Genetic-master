Veda has invited Mr Dale and his legal representatives to propose any means (other than an applicant's consent) by which it may be lawful for them to disclose personal information contained in, for example, Mr Dale's credit information file to the other eight applicants and to the representatives of DR Capital. Ms Barbour labels exhibit RAB1 "Investigations", exhibit RAB2 "File processing", and RAB3 "Complaints". 4 The motion falls into two parts. 26 The evidence led by Veda, however, shows that CRA's business is that of assisting individuals in remedying allegedly erroneous credit ratings in respect of them.
