6 The application before me arises from a hearing in these proceedings last Thursday 29 May 2008 before Jarrett FM, where the applicant sought an adjournment of the hearing listed for 4 June 2008. The affidavit by Barbara Genz has alterations to the "Date Affirmed" without being initialled. He seeks an order granting judgment by default against the respondent against Federal Court Rules Order 35A rule 3. He has not been given sufficient time to prepare his case before trial. I understand that the respondent filed a response and supporting affidavit on 24 December 2007.
