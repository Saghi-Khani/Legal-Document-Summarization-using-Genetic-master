However, at the hearing the respondents appeared by solicitors Messrs Gray and Perkins who filed a notice of appearance on that date. 7 On 24 August 2005, the matter was listed for hearing of the application for default judgment. It was served on Friday, 3 February 2006, which is less than the three days clear notice prescribed by the rules. The applicant seeks default judgment by reason of the failure of the respondents to defend the proceedings with due diligence. 2 The notice of motion seeking default judgment was filed in court today. The amount claimed is $125,193.95.
