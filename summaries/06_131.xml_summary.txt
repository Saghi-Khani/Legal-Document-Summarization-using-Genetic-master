15 By a summons dated 6 June 2005, the appellant applied to set aside the 5 November judgment. On 14 April 2004, I swore an affidavit in the Supreme Court Proceedings which deposed as to circumstances relevant to my Defence and Counterclaim. 16 The respondent appealed against the orders of Master Evans. Given the theft conviction there appears no merit in the respondent making any further application to the Supreme Court to proceed with his alleged counterclaim. 21 On 17 August 2005, Hartnett FM made a sequestration order against the appellant. The summons came on for hearing before Master Wheeler.
