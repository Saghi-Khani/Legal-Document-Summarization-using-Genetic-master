Alternatively, the court may make final orders in relation to the claims for relief. On 12 September 2005, the Tribunal sent a letter to the applicant addressed to the mailing address nominated in Section D of the Application for Review. 3 The application was made pursuant to r 44.01 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) ('FMCR'). The Tribunal failed to give procedural fairness. An examination of the Tribunal decision does not suggest a basis for considering that any jurisdictional error occurred. 15 Accordingly, I propose to dismiss the application for leave to appeal with costs.
