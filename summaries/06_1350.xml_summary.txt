This order is made under s 57 of the Act. Since the settlement however, a new Board has evidently been appointed by resolution of a meeting of CRI. It comprises the first respondent, Dr Gray, a member of the firm of legal practitioners representing him (Mr Sanders) and his sister, Ms Daebritz. As receiver of those shares he will have the power to exercise all of CRI's rights as shareholder. One estimate of its value earlier in these proceedings was $11 million.
