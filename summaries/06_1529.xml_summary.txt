SZITZ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1529 (15 November 2006) 10 There was some confusion, apparently, with a reference made by the appellant in his amended application before the Federal Magistrate to 'drug lords' in Pakistan. The appellant appealed against this decision to the Federal Magistrates Court. However, the Tribunal found the appellant's claims to be vague and lacking in details. One of the grounds for the application says, quote:    The Refugee Review Tribunal did not appreciate the facts and the circumstances of the case. These were factual conclusions that were open to the Tribunal.
