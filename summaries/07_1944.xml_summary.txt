In proceeding NSD 1447 of 2007, I had ordered that the plaintiff, Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL), convene a meeting of all holders of shares in PBL for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to a scheme of arrangement (the PBL Scheme). The Crown shareholders present and voting (either in person or by proxy) passed a resolution approving the Demerger Scheme also by the majorities required by s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Act. 4 At the second court hearing held on 28 November 2007, I made orders confirming the two Schemes.
