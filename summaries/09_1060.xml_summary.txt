The second notice of motion sought a declaration that the resolution of the directors of the Company passed on 19 August 2009 was valid and terminated any executive roles of Mr Stawiczny in the business of the Company. The meeting did not occur at 8.00am on 19 August 2009 as Mr Stawiczny was not present. On 7 September 2009 the plaintiff, Stawiczny Family Pty Ltd, filed an originating process and an interlocutory process. One was described as "Minutes of a Meeting of the Directors" of the Company. Mr Stawiczny did not hear what Mr Dunford or Mr Anderson said.
