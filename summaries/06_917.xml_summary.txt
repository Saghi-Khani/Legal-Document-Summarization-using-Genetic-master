Orders  46 For the reasons given, in matter 31/97 I order that the costs ordered to be paid by Mr Dunstan to the defendant by order of 14 September 1998 be fixed in the gross sum of $11,200. 32 Mr Chapman was cross-examined by Mr Dunstan. He indicated also that he would take every point available on the taxations. The taxing officer could adjudicate on the individual items of work claimed. Order 62 r 4(2) refers expressly to circumstances where the Court orders costs to be paid. I do not propose to further consider that submission.
