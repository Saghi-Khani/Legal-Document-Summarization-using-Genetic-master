10 I also commend the legal representatives of the parties who have so ably assisted them to reach this noteworthy agreement. The Agreement was registered by the Tribunal on 15 August 2007. The orders that the Court is invited to make today will recognise the existence of the native title held by the Githabul People in the consent determination area. It reflects great credit on the Githabul People and particularly the named applicant Mr Trevor Close, the State of New South Wales, NTSCORP Limited and the Casino Rural Lands Protection Board. 15  I now formally adjourn the Court.
