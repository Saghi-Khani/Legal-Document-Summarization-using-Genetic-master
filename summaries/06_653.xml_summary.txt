The Tribunal upheld a decision of a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ("the Minister") made on 30 April 2003 refusing the applicant's application for a protection visa. In my view, the reasons for decision do not indicate that the RRT used the material in the file as a reason or part of any reason to reach its decision. The RRT concluded that the independent information indicated that family related violence was a significant problem in Fiji. The RRT reasons also state that the case merits consideration on humanitarian grounds.
