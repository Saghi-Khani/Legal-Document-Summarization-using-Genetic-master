On 21 August 2008, the applicant commenced acquiring, through nominee companies, shares in OMH. The applicant pointed out that on his proxy form, Mr Ong directed his votes in favour of resolutions approving the issue of options to the other directors and executives but abstained in relation to the resolution for the issue of options to himself. The explanatory memorandum made it clear that Mr Low was Ms Heng Siow Kwee's spouse. For the reasons which follow, this application is dismissed. The ASX had previously approved the notice of general meeting of OMH and the explanatory statement.
