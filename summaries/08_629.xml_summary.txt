â€¢ The 28 November 2007 version of the cross-claim was also defective. The applicants (as cross-respondents), in their notice of motion dated 26 November 2007, sought an order that the cross-claimants' notices of motion and the attached pleadings be removed from the Court file. 6 I granted the respondents leave to file and serve further amended defences on or before 15 November 2007. Those further and better particulars had been requested on 4 June 2007. These allegations were subsequently varied. I do not consider that the applicants have made good their claim for indemnity costs.
