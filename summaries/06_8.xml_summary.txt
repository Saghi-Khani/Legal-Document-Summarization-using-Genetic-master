The broadcasting services of the Broadcaster are presently transmitted in the Brisbane area by AusCoast under the auspices of the 1620 licence. The Authority made thereby a decision under s 111 not to effect a variation to one of the conditions it had imposed on the 1620 licence pursuant to s 107(1)(g) of the Act, namely the condition stipulating the transmission site. 63 Accordingly the application for review of the first decision sought by the applicants' amended application filed in Court on 25 August 2005 must proceed to a final hearing.
