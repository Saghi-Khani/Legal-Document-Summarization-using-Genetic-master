42 According to Mr O'Farrell's affidavit, by September 2007 the ATO formed the view that Part IVA of the ITAA 1936 might apply to the REPO arrangement, and that accordingly JHAF had a potential liability for income tax for the year ended 31 March 2002. CONCLUSION  92 For the reasons given above, there should be an order that ASIC reinstate the registration of JHAF and that Mr Donnelly be appointed liquidator. Mr Green filed that return on 23 May 2005. In other words, on 2 November 2001 JHAF paid a total of $1,051,500,227 to JHFBV.
