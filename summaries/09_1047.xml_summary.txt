I am, however, satisfied that the ONA's claim to be excused from producing the remaining 47 intelligence reports and those distribution lists which relate only to those 47 reports has been made out. AWB served a subpoena upon the Office of National Assessments ( the ONA ) requiring the production of various documents and reports. Mr Cole's final report is publicly available. All relevant intelligence agencies within the Australian intelligence community were consulted in order to ensure that the risk of a successful mosaic analysis being undertaken by persons likely to act contrary to the interests of Australia was minimised.
