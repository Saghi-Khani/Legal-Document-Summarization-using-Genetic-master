The application brought before the Federal Magistrate sought judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('Tribunal') made on 30 September 2004 adversely to the applicant's claim for refugee status advanced pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'). However, by Order 52 rule 15(2) of the FCR, the time limit of 21 days may be extended where a 'special reason' exists. 1 This is an application for extension of time within which to file and serve a notice of appeal from the judgment of Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones of 25 January 2006.
