11 Therefore, the Minister says, on either of these two lines of argument, the action or determination which Mr Asaad challenges is a "migration decision" within the meaning of the Act , which this Court does not have jurisdiction to review. It is also not necessary to consider whether the reasonable practicability of a non-citizen's removal is a jurisdictional fact in s 198(6) of the Act . 22 Accordingly, I order that this proceeding be transferred to the Federal Magistrates Court. 2 The applicant, Mr Asaad, has been in immigration detention since August 2005.
