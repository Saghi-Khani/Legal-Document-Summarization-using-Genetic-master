Forestry Tasmania also seeks an order under O 15 r 18 of the Rules of the Court that undertakings as to confidentiality of its material continue to apply, notwithstanding the tender of relevant material to the Court. On 21 March 2006, following the application by Ms Gee, Mr Agnew and Ms Meredith, the respondent filed its motion. As such, if the prejudice which the respondent seeks to prevent by way of the s 50 order is the viewing of the maps in the manner described, the application cannot be said to be necessary in order to prevent this prejudice.
