CONCLUSION  28 I refuse the application for summary judgment made by Shelston. 20 The second set of deficiencies in the FASC which are identified concern the pleadings in relation to the trade practices claim. Where the alleged conspiracy involves unlawful means or acts, then it is sufficient if only one of several of the purposes of the conspiracy was to injure the aggrieved party. I order that the applicants pay the costs thrown away as the result of amendments to the Statement of Claim and Amended Statement of Claim. They are its agents who have power to control its acts.
