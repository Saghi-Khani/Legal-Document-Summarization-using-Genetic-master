Hunter Valley was served on 2 December. Order 6 rule 4(2) provides that an application for leave under r 2 may be made without serving of the notice of motion. 39 I grant leave to Vintage to join Mr Johnston as the third respondent in the proceedings. In any event, leave granted on 29 November did not include leave to file an amended application. I agree. On 14 December 2005, Mr Johnston received from Vintage's solicitors a letter dated 2 December together with the FASC and amended application. (2) Does the joinder take effect within the limitation period?
