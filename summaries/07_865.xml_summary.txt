I will hear oral submissions from Counsel by way of closing address today. 24 I also grant leave to the respondents to file and serve any written submissions in reply by 4.00 pm 13 June 2007. 5 On 28 May 2007, the solicitors for the respondents filed written submissions as ordered. 1 This morning in Court Mr Perry for the applicants made two applications. 12 Second, the parties were granted an extra 12 days to prepare written submissions. As Deputy District Registrar Belcher said, this is a generous amount of time.
