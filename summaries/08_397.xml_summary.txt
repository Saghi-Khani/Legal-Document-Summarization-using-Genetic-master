6 The Tribunal decided that: (a) The deductions claimed by each respondent were to be disallowed except for actual cash payments made by each respondent. Accordingly, in light of the decisions in Starr and Hopkins, the Tribunal concludes that the [Commissioner] should not have imposed penalties under section 224(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . The relevant penalty section where there has been a determination under Pt IVA , is s 226. The amended assessments also included, by way of penalty, additional tax. 7 The Commissioner appealed against the Tribunal's decision in respect of penalty tax.
