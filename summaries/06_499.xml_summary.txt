7 The reasons for judgment of Barnes FM are not attended by sufficient doubt and rightly emphasised in particular the importance of the Courts exercising original jurisdiction in migration proceedings not to permit repeated adjudication of challenges to the original Tribunal decision. Barnes FM had dismissed as an abuse of process the application filed in the Federal Magistrates Court on 18 August 2005. 5 The applicants have failed to identify any conceivably viable arguable ground of appeal. The applicants' written submissions also seek in substance and reality impermissible merits review. The applicants comprise a husband, wife and two children.
