The respondent challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to entertain the application on the basis that the claim had not been made within the time specified in the 1930 Act. More importantly, however, the applicant's claim, as put to Senior Member Allen at the preliminary hearing, was for compensation for the 'disease' cervical spondylosis, that first occurred after the commencement of the 1971 Act. I agree with this submission. The applicant relied on the report of Dr David Champion, which is the only report referred to in the Tribunal's reasons for its decision.
