Mr Close considered that many of the safety matters about which concerns had previously been raised had been remedied. The first respondent has left the third respondent's employ. The applicant is an inspector appointed pursuant to s 57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (the "BCII Act"). The third respondent cannot be treated as being innocent of previous infringements. However the conduct was quite extreme and completely unacceptable. I fix the penalty at $9,000. I fix the penalty at $40,000. It seems that he is no longer involved in the industrial relations field.
