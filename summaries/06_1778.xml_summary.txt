(b) To the extent that this Honourable Court determines questions (a)(i) and (ii) above adversely to the respondent, should the Court order the respondent to provide voting booths at the next Federal election "in accordance with law" so that they comply with requirements of the relevant provisions of the Act? That sets out that the applicant had found the voting booths provided to voters at the polling place at the Manjimup Town Hall on 9 October 2004 did not adequately screen voters from observation and that other persons could observe voters while they were marking their ballot-papers.
