2 The Court is sitting here today on the Yakka Yakka Track south of Balgo to hear an application for the determination of native title. I will give my reasons now. 10 But before I sign the Court's orders, I want to say this. We want to see people live in peace. The claimants have been very careful to put their case properly and the State of Western Australia has considered it very well. Close the Court, please, Mr Sheppard. Thus you people are central people and this is the central land. The Court determines that native title exists.
