14 In the Supreme Court the set-off of costs is governed by r 63.55 (1) of the Court's Rules. 4 On 12 May 2006, on an application for summary judgment, the judge (Dodds-Streeton J) held that Dr Boman Irani and the plaintiffs were liable to pay the costs incurred by the Bank. On 27 March 2008 he made orders in the same terms as the Master. The only reason that has been put forward is the pending appeal. The court has an inherent power to set-off costs orders made in different proceedings.
