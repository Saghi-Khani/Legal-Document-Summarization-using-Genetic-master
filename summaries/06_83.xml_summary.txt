Accordingly, I am satisfied that the applicant has established charge 8 beyond reasonable doubt against Maskiell and Design Elegance. However, Louis Vuitton made offers to Maskiell to compromise or settle the claims it was entitled to pursue as a result of her re-infringing conduct in breach of the Court's orders. On 4 August 2005 proceedings for civil and criminal contempt were commenced. 22 Having regard to all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the importation of the sixty-one counterfeit products was for a commercial purpose, being their resale.
