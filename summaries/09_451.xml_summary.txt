At that time the "appellants" appeared by counsel. On 13 March 2009, the first directions hearing in respect of each of these matters was held. Three days later SMS Technology Australia and Mr Hutcheson filed what again purports to be a notice of appeal in respect of what seems to be a separate, but not unrelated, proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court in which judgment had also been given on 29 January 2009. The respondent named in that purported appeal is one Abdullah M.A. Hamed. In each instance, leave to appeal was not obtained within 21 days.
