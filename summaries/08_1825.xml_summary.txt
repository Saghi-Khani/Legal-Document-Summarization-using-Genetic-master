I propose to approve the compromise of the proceeding, and to order that the agreed sum be paid by the first respondent into court. The applicant's mother has made her application to be joined as a party in person. The applicant, by his next friend, his father, complained of discrimination in the provision of educational services by the first respondent, pursuant to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth). The parents are already litigating in the Federal Magistrates Court. The resolution involved the signing of terms of settlement. Breach of them would not attract any liability for contempt of court.
