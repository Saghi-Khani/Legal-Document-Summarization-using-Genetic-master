It is sufficient for present purposes to observe that the draft notice of appeal raises substantial issues relating to the interrelationship of the federal instruments and the State Act, and whether inconsistency in the constitutional sense arises between them. Marshall J found that no relevant inconsistency existed. The respondent supports the application. Jemena Asset Management Pty Ltd v Coinvest Limited [2009] FCA 542 (21 May 2009) In his judgment, his Honour answered a series of questions which the parties had asked the court to decide separately from any other question in the proceeding. Leave to appeal will be granted.
