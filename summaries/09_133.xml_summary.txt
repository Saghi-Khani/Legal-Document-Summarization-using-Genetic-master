The second and third defendants, Mr Wayne Harris and Mr Thomas MacKellar, were directors of the company when each of the six payments described in para 6 of the affidavit of Mr Mark Anthony Conlan sworn 27 August 2008 (filed 2 September 2008) were made to the Commissioner. I propose to make an order pursuant to s 588FF(1) directing the Commissioner of Taxation to pay to the liquidator an amount of $116,830.00 representing the total of the six voidable transactions. Both applications came before the Court on 4 February 2009.
