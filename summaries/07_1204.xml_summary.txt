15 Ground 3 complains that the RRT failed to find that the appellant, by reason of the senior position he held in the monastery, would suffer discrimination and persecution. 18 The Minister submits that there was no material before the RRT which clearly raised any such claim, or how (if at all) membership of that group would distinguish the appellant from Buddhist monks generally. The section does not, however, require an opportunity to be given to respond to every item of particular evidence. Grounds 6, 8, 9 and 10 simply invite merits review.
