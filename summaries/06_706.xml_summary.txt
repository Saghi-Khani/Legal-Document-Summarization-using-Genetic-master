The Court, exercising the function of the Commissioner, may take into account a ground of opposition specified in s 59 whether relied on by the opponent or not (see s 60(2)). King J allowed the appeal and ordered that the patent application proceed to grant. I do not think that this view is inconsistent with the judgment of Walsh, J. in Caroma Sales Pty Ltd v Philmac Pty Ltd (1972), 46 ALJR 324, in which case the appellant adduced affidavit evidence and called oral evidence on a patent appeal hearing at which neither the respondent nor the Commissioner appeared.
