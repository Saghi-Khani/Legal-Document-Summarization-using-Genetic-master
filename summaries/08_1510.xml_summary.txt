The statement of claim fails sufficiently to describe or otherwise identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates. In paragraph 38 it is claimed that the respondents overcharged for rubber products. 35 No attempt is made to plead any material facts concerning the directions which it is said caused the Australian companies to engage in price fixing or to impose exclusionary provisions. The applicant alleges that the two Australian companies engaged in this conduct pursuant to the global cartel arrangement and the periodic cartel arrangements (paragraph 27). These paragraphs plead the applicant's case in the most general terms.
