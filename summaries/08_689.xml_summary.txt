FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT   6 On 13 April 2007 the appellant filed an application seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in the Federal Magistrates Court. Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate considered whether the appellant had an arguable case (see: MZXPW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FMCA 480). A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on 8 August 2006. Accordingly, it is inappropriate that leave to appeal should be granted. He claimed that his family treated him poorly when he told them of the conversion.
