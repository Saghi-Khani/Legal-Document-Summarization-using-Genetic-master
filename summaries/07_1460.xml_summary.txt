'  15 At 3:00 pm that day Mr Roberts and Ms Paterson met with Mr Nairne, Mr Patchett and Mr Osborne. 27 I conclude that the only reasons why Mr Roberts' employment by the Club was terminated were that his position of Level 5 Supervisor became redundant following the implementation of the catering division's restructure and he was unwilling to accept the lower paid position of Chef. Mr Roberts applied unsuccessfully for the new position of Chef de Partie. 12 Two relevant meetings took place on 17 October 2006.
