The Further Amended Defence does not plead to or traverse the allegations in pars 8.3 to 8.6, and 16.1 to 16.5, and 16.7 of the Statement of Claim. Paragraph 12 of the FAD denies the relevant representations were made. The ACCC says that it is clear that the respondents dispute that the relevant representations were made. In my opinion, the effect of O 11 r 13 is that in the absence of a specific denial or non-admission of an allegation, there is deemed to be an admission.
