225 I find that Bugeja deliberately copied the alfresco quadrant from the Seattle 31, by reference to a floor plan and discussions with Popple who had the benefit of actually inspecting the Seattle 31 display home. Popple indicated, however, that because the similarities were "too close" between the Pavillion and Prototype 20A, that design was not used. The family was in the Metricon house before that, in that position. The respondent had then incorporated aspects from the applicant's copyright work into the original starting design owned by the respondent. In November 2001, Palazzesi, Popple, Biasin and Bugeja visited Perth.
