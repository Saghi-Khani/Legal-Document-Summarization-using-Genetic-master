4 The administrators received from Romfal Corporate Pty Ltd, acting on behalf of a syndicate of investors, a proposal that, if implemented, would have both AHG and Pharmeasy execute a deed of company arrangement that would see creditors' claims compromised and AHG relisted. Nor did it require adoption of the priorities that applied in a winding up. The administrators were of the view that if AHG were wound up both employee and unsecured creditors would receive nothing. The skilled workers may be difficult to replace. Mr Atkinson agreed. The court's power to approve a deed is limited.
