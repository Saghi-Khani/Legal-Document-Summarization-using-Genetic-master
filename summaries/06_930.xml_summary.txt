The court deals as a commonplace with administrative appeals of this nature. Keen v Telstra Corporation Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 930 (4 July 2006) 3 Ms Keen argues that, excluding GST, her total costs of this appeal amount to about $38,000 including the $21,000 for solicitors' fees, $12,000 for counsel. 4 The purpose of a fixed costs order under O 62 r 4(2)(c) is to save the parties the time, trouble, delay, expense and aggravation in having a taxation proceed on a matter. The power is appropriate to be used in complex cases.
