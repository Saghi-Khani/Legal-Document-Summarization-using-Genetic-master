The second issue is that the Scheme Implementation Agreement (SIA) dated 13 September 2009 between ERC and ECC provided for payment of a break fee by ERC to ECC of $4 million, which was 1.9% of the equity value of ERC. In that case, each Scheme Participant who has elected to receive Scrip Consideration will be entitled to receive only a reduced number of ECC Shares determined by the Scale Back formula, and Cash Consideration for the remaining Scheme Shares held. ERC has followed a practice of returning surplus capital to its shareholders.
