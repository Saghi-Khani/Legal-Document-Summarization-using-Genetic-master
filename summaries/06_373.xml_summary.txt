The Tribunal held that although the Appellant and Deceased lived in a "marital relationship at common law" in order for them to be seen as "ordinarily (living) together as husband and wife on a permanent and bonafide basis" the couple needed to be living under the same roof. ' The s 8A(4)(a) tests refer to 'wholly or substantially dependent on the other person at the time'. The decision of the Trustee will therefore be affirmed. The Tribunal considered that this further issue involved ' some difficulty '. Accordingly, she was "partially dependent" upon the payment made by the deceased.
