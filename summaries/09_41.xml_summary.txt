Edmonds J referred (at [30]) to the definition of "Australian tax" in s 3(1) of the Agreements Act as meaning, relevantly, "income tax imposed as such by an Act". The second submission made by the First Applicant is that the tax on capital gains under the Pt IIIA r√©gime is a "substantially similar tax" to the UK capital gains tax referred to in Art 1(1)(a). Article 7 applied to "[t]he profits on an enterprise". It follows that if the respective capital gains fell within the Business Profits Articles, Australia was prevented from taxing those capital gains.
