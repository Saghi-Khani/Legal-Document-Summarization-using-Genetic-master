18 In my view, although there are also references to the phrase 'fit and proper person' and 'good fame, integrity and character', these matters were not considered in the context of the ultimate issue of whether the applicant was the prescribed fit and proper person, but in the context only of whether 'special circumstances' existed for the purposes of s 251BC(3). The appeal is brought pursuant to s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ('the AAT Act'). If not satisfied, the Board 'shall refuse' to re-register the applicant: s 251JC(2).
