â€¢ Some conduct by the respondent which is said to be directed to the implementation of the December 2005 decision such as the transfer of the aircraft and the loss of remuneration and leave entitlements occurred after 27 March 2006 and yet is relied on to support alleged contraventions of s 298K. Although para 32 covers conduct occurring both before and after 27 March 2006, para 32A pleads that "in the premises" the respondent has contravened s 298K. Not deterred the applicant filed a further amended application and a second further amended statement of claim on 30 November 2006.
