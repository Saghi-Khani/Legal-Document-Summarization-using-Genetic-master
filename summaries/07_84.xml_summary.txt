In Re WebCentral Group Ltd (No 2) (2006) 58 ACSR 742, Lindgren J approved a scheme of arrangement, on condition that the 'no encumbrances' clause, which was cl 9.3(b) of that scheme of arrangement, was deleted. Therefore, in accordance with s 1322(2) of the Corporations Act , the meeting is not invalidated because of the procedural irregularity in the giving of the inadequate period of notice. However, circumstances occurred which resulted in the members of the plaintiff in fact receiving 27 days notice of the members' meeting held on 13 December 2006. These are my reasons.
