Federal Magistrate Nicholls "dismissed the case without considering the legal and factual errors contained in the decision of the [Tribunal]". 4 The Tribunal reached these conclusions. The Tribunal compared that material with the evidence of the witness (the person with whom the appellant claimed to have a homosexual relationship in Australia) called before the Tribunal by the appellant. The Tribunal addressed the submissions made by the appellant's adviser of 2 August 2006. The Tribunal was simply not satisfied that the appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason, as contended.
