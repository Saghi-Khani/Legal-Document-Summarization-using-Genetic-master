The applicant did not make any submissions but relied upon her amended application. This was because the Tribunal had found her claims of a well-founded fear of persecution were not made out. An amended application was filed on 20 March 2006. The applicant arrived in Australia in July 2005. The applicant claimed that she had narrowly escaped a massacre in Hindu dominated areas by Muslims supported by the police. Shortly after her arrival she applied for a protection visa. The learned Federal Magistrate listed the matter for hearing under r 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Courts Rules.
