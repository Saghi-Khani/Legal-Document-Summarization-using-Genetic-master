Mr Khatri has filed a very candid and detailed affidavit in respect of the present position of Victorian Families Retirement and Investment Group. Storm Financial Limited (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Administrators Appointed) v Victorian Families Retirement & Investment Group Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 294 (18 March 2009) In that winding-up application, there has been brought today an application for the appointment of provisional liquidators to that company. Nonetheless, it seems to me that the sentiments voiced by Barrett J at para 13 are pertinent. There is a residual common law power for the members, in general meeting, to appoint directors.
