Ground 3 --- Decision Premature  34 Mr Rivera submitted that the President's decision was premature because there may be legal issues arising in the Supreme Court proceedings which would have prevented him from pursuing that claim against the Commonwealth. 4 However, on 13 September 2007 the Commission exercised its powers under s 20(2) of the HREOC Act by deciding not to continue to inquire into Mr Rivera's complaints. 17 On 30 May 2007 Ms McCabe replied to Mr Rivera. Mr Rivera raised these very contentions in his letter of 5 June 2007 to the Commission.
