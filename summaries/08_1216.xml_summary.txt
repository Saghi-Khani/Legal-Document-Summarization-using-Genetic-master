Counsel for Mr Fernando's tutor accepted that there was no evidence of any intention on the part of the respondent to exercise the power to cancel Mr Fernando's visa personally. 2 In September 2001, the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs issued Mr Fernando with a notice of intention to cancel Mr Fernando's permanent residency visa. 19 It is necessary, therefore, to consider whether this Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine the originating application. 21 Section 5 of the Act provides that a "migration decision" includes a "privative clause decision".
