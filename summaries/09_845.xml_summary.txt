Spencer v Neo Rock Pty Ltd ACN 110 874 283 (In Liquidation) [2009] FCA 845 (3 August 2009) Mr Vicca expressed certain opinions about the balance debt due to the Deputy Commissioner. As a result, an application was made to the Court for the winding up of the company on that ground. The primary judge considered the authorities on the proper application of the prohibition upon leave under s 459S of the Corporations Act . The affidavit annexed a proposed Notice of Appeal. The matter came before Logan J. Unfortunately, no affidavit material is filed which supports that proposition.
