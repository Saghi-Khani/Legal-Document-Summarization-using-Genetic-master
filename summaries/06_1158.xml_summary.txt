It follows, in my opinion, that the respondent is not entitled to its costs of the motion and the applicant should have his costs of the argument about costs. The proceeding was listed for first directions within days of the filing of the motion. The applicant serve on the respondent a draft amended notice of appeal on or before 18 May 2006. That is normally the occasion to raise procedural issues. The applicant should bear his own costs up to and including 27 April 2006. The motion was supported by an affidavit of a solicitor sworn on 19 April 2006.
