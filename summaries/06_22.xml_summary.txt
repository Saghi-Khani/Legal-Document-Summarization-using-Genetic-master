At the same time, I rejected the respondents' contention that the applicants' case should be dismissed because the applicants had failed to adduce evidence quantifying that loss. In so doing, I noted that (1) the applicants had presented evidence that the Commonwealth had incurred significant, though unquantified, costs in the investigation and prosecution of the first respondent ("Bradshaw"); (2) the respondents conceded that compensable loss included the costs to the Commonwealth of investigating the conduct of Bradshaw; and (3) such costs might equal or exceed the bond amount. For the reasons that follow, I would refuse such leave.
