His appeal was dismissed under s 25(2B)(bb)(ii) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) which provides that the Court may make an order that an appeal be dismissed if the appellant fails to attend a hearing relating to the appeal. 13 The application for judicial review of the decision of the RRT was dismissed on 1 June 2007 ( SZGET v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship & Anor [2007] FMCA 836). The allegations of error which were made by the applicant must certainly be rejected. The appeal was listed on a third occasion on 12 December 2007.
