In the present case, I consider that the appellant has adopted the information contained in his original application for a protection visa. SZCNP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1140 (29 August 2006) The Federal Magistrate found that the reasoning of the Tribunal was open to it on the evidence, and that the Tribunal had identified and addressed all the claims made by the appellant. At par [43], the Tribunal stated that it would not accept the claim of post-traumatic stress because no evidence had been provided by the appellant in support of this claim.
