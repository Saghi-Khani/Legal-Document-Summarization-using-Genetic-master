It is contended by the applicant that the Court might find that, although the first respondent's concern about the human rights of Aboriginal inhabitants of the Reserve to be secure in their person was genuine, it was not a reasonable response to enact the Reserves Act, revoking the 2002 Management Order which was in favour of the SVC. Bella Bropho was such an inhabitant. There was not any racially discriminatory purpose of the Reserves Act. Since 13 June 2003 the Administrator has permitted access to the Reserve to persons who have had a legitimate reason to do so.
