1 I do not think the plaintiffs require permission before they give discovered documents to IMF (Australia) Ltd, the company that is providing them with the funds to prosecute this action. 2 Early cases, such as Richardson v Hastings (1884) 7 Beav 354 and Reynolds v Godlee (1858) 4 K & J 88, state that discovery may be refused unless the party gives an undertaking that the documents would not be used for any purpose other than the action then proceeding. There are also cases where a non-party has a legitimate interest in seeing discovered documents.
