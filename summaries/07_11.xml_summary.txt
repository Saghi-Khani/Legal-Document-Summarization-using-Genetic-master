1 In this proceeding, the applicant ('ACCC') alleged that the second respondent ('CEPU') was an accessory to conduct on the part of the first respondent ('Edison') that contravened ss 45E(3) and 45EA of Pt IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('TPA'). Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v IPM Operation and Maintenance Loy Yang Pty Ltd (No 2) [2007] FCA 11 (16 January 2007) I agree that these three factors are relevant and ought to be taken into account in determining penalty. The CEPU was a necessary signatory to the Simon Engineering site agreement.
