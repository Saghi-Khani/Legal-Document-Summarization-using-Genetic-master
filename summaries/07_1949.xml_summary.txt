The Tribunal heard the Appellant's evidence and made its findings on these issues of fact. The Tribunal was thus on notice of the difficulties said to be operating and there was no assertion by the Appellant in his 9 March 2007 letter that the departmental account was not correct. First, it is not considered that there was any requirement to provide the Appellant with transcript or recording of the interview . On 14 December 2006 the Appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of the decision. The Federal Magistrates Court therefore dismissed the Application. GROUNDS OF APPEAL.
