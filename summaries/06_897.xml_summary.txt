Similar factual and legal issues arise in respect of all the respondents' defamation claims. Also by notice of motion dated 23 June 2006, the respondents/cross-claimants ("the respondents") seek orders that they be granted leave to file and serve a second further amended defence and cross-claim. 14 As noted earlier, the applicants also sought an order for the separate determination of certain questions under O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules . 7 In this connection, the remaining matter concerns the applicants' submission that the proposed new defamation claim would not be within the Court's jurisdiction.
