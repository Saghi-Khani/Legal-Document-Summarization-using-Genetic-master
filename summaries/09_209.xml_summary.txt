The tribunal concluded that this fact suggested that the appellant's desire to remain in Australia was stronger than his desire to live with Ms L and their child and brought into question his commitment to a familial or de facto relationship. The fact that an applicant for review asked the tribunal to take evidence from a person cannot make everything that the person said, if the tribunal called him or her to give evidence, information that the applicant gave to the tribunal. Appellant: Nine years. GROUND 3: DID THE TRIBUNAL FAIL TO COMPLY WITH S 424A OF THE ACT?
