The Agreement involved a sale to First United of Forestview's interest in a joint venture and in two shopping centres on land in Forrestfield. 32 The liquidators rely upon s 1322(4)(d) of the Act and seek an extension of "the period for making an application under s 477(2B)" seeking approval that the plaintiffs may "enter into" the Agreement dated 31 August 2007. The option may be exercised at any time after the occurrence of the event of default under clause 13.1. On those principles the Court does not rubber stamp the liquidator's proposal.
