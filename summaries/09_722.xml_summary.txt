Ms Yousif made a claim in paragraph 77(b) which amounted to over $1 million in lost earnings. In all the circumstances, both the application for indemnity costs by the Bank and the application for costs by Ms Yousif are rejected. Yousif v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (No 3) [2009] FCA 722 (30 June 2009) It was, perhaps, unlikely that Ms Yousif would persuade the Court that her high earnings would continue. The offer made, if confined to this claim, was therefore $80,000 against a potential $140,000. The entitlement to the bonus payments was never in question.
