The question of the accuracy of the 'country information' is one for the Tribunal, not for the Court. The final ground challenged the RRT's finding regarding relocation. The reason was simple. Associate:Dated: 9 August 2007  The Appellant appeared in person. It was the RRT's second decision, in 2005, that was the subject of the application for review before Federal Magistrate Cameron. He first claimed that the RRT had relied upon country information that was outdated. His Honour concluded that the appropriate inference was simply that the RRT preferred the earlier country information to the later information.
