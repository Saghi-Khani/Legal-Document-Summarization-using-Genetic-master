In my view, it is clear that the principal aspect of these proceedings concerned the question whether Mrs Tracy was in fact liable for non-party costs. The first and second respondents were unsuccessful in respect of their notice of motion. Is Mrs Tracy entitled to indemnity costs? The first and second respondents have submitted that Mrs Tracy ought to pay their costs in respect of the jurisdictional issue. As I indicated on 20 February 2009, Mrs Tracy was entitled to file written submissions by 6 February 2009 in relation to notice of motion as a whole.
