At the Tribunal hearing, the wife appellant claimed also to have a well-founded fear of persecution having a similar or related fear to that of her husband. I do not find that either MZWMQ or Applicant M47 are plainly wrong and, consequently, I am persuaded that the evidence given by the wife appellant is excepted under s 424A(3)(b). 10 In my opinion, the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal cannot be faulted jurisprudentially and the appeal must therefore be dismissed.
