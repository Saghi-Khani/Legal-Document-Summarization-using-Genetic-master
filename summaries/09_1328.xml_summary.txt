The Federal Magistrates Court held that, in so deciding, the Tribunal erred in its construction of one aspect of the statutory provisions (the meaning of "main business") but that the error was immaterial because the Tribunal's decision was based on another independent ground relating to the question of the first appellant's "ownership interest" in any such "main business" at the time of the decision about the visa application ( Ibrahim & Ors v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2009] FMCA 593). In the present case the appellants cannot surmount either materiality requirement. The appellants submitted that this followed from first principles.
