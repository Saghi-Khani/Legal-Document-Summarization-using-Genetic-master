4 On 9 September 2005, a Deed of Company Arrangement was executed pursuant to a resolution of the creditors in accordance with s 439C(a) of the Act at the meeting convened under s 439A of the Act (the DOCA). This case raises another question --- whether approval can, or should, be given to an increase in the remuneration of the deed administrator post liquidation. 5 The Deed Fund under the DOCA was constituted by cl 5 and cl 6 of the DOCA which provided, inter alia, for RSP to pay certain funds to the administrators at certain times.
