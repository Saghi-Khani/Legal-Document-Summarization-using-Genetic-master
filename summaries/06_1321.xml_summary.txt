AFFIDAVIT MATERIAL   5 In an affidavit filed on 15 August 2006 in support of the motion, the second respondent deposes that:   "I and the Third Respondent herein seek to have the Applicant provide Security For Costs in this proceeding on the ground that the Applicant is ordinarily resident outside Australia. The Court may order security for costs in the exercise of its discretion, after considering all the circumstances of the case. In these circumstances, I reject the respondents' submission that she is ordinarily resident outside Australia. He has not identified any particular matter that would warrant cross-examination.
