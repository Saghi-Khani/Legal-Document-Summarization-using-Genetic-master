5 Since 1993 the subsidiaries have taken advantage of the class orders and have not prepared or lodged any financial reports. 1 Section 1322(4)(d) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) confers power upon the court to extend or abridge the period for doing any act "in relation to a corporation". ASIC has made an order under the section which provides that relief but only if certain conditions are satisfied. I have already indicated that the provision will operate in respect of periods fixed by the Corporations Act and by the rules or regulations made under the Corporations Act .
