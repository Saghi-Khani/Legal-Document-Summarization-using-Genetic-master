Second issue --- application of sale of fruit proceeds  7 In the year ended 31 March 1991 the proceeds of fruit sales due were $26,400. The difference represents an amount apparently paid to Johnson Farm Management. Rural Finance's books of account are only consistent with it never having received the $15,000. 2 Differences have arisen between the parties as to the appropriate calculation of interest for which I have held Mr Guest is entitled to deductions. Written submissions have been filed. 1 On 23 February 2007 I delivered reasons substantially upholding Mr Guest's contentions in this matter.
