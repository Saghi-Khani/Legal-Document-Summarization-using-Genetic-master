36 Accordingly, there was no error in the approach taken by the Tribunal, namely that the appellant's son would be free to lodge a spouse visa application to return to Australia. 2 A delegate of the Minister exercised the power contained in s 109 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) to cancel Mrs Burton's spouse visa. However, in 2003 Mr Burton "withdrew" his earlier sworn evidence as to the genuineness of the marriage. One of Mrs Burton's sons, Mr Vikash Burton, is married with two children. The Migration Review Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision.
