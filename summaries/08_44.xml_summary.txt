11 Employees of Adelaide Petroleum were invited to an information session on 2 August 2006. Regulation 8.13(2) also requires certain signatures on workplace agreements to be accompanied by the full name and address of each person signing the workplace agreement. At the time of giving his evidence Bill could not recall anything material said by Ms Elm at the assessment session. He too had a limited memory of the details of the conversation between Mr Schulze and Ms Elm. While he was employed by Adelaide Petroleum Bill's employment was regulated by an AWA.
