5 On 15 July 2003, within the 28-day time limit that he was allowed, the applicant filed in the Federal Magistrates Court an application with respect to the complaint, pursuant to s 46PO(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act . It is because I regard the grant of leave to appeal, and the institution of any appeal, as futile for the reasons that I have given. The basis of complaint in the affidavit appears to be what occurred around the hearing before HREOC in December 1997. The applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding.
