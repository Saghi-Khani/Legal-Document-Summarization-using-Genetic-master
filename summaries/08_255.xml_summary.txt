Mr Flint explained in his oral evidence that in essence the available funds did not permit Mr Crowe's retainer to continue. Senior and junior counsel represented the cross-claimants. He indicated that he would provide his detailed reasons later. The applicant was represented during that week by Mr R. Crowe SC and Mr M. Orlov of counsel. Mr Orlov alone appeared today.
