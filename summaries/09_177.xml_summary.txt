It was not until 30 January 2009 that Mr Reidy ascertained that the plant and equipment owned by AOL is subject to a mortgage debenture to the ANZ Bank Limited. The land forms part of the assets of a managed investment scheme. It seems to me that the proper approach to this application is to permit the creditors to adjourn the date of the second meeting. The directors therefore resolved on 19 November 2008 that Mr Reidy be appointed as administrator of COGL pursuant to section 436A of the Act. COGL and AOL have the same directors but different shareholders.
