13 The appeal will be allowed as indicated but the appellant is to pay the respondents' costs. 3 A1's office manager, the second respondent, Ms Touma, took the vehicle to the appellant's premises for the appellant to service and carry out any necessary repairs on the vehicle. That failure however does not seem to me to deal with what the appellant might have reasonably foreseen. The case was that it was not foreseeable that somebody would or could dishonestly obtain one of A1's other keys, and steal the vehicle from the appellant's premises.
