13 The alternative relief sought by the first respondent in this case is that the proceedings be stayed until VCAT has determined the issue referred to VCAT by the County Court on 6 December 2006. 7 At this stage in the course of giving reasons for decision the applicant sought to file an affidavit of her own sworn on 20 December 2006. 3 A number of preliminary matters were raised by the applicant in the proceedings responding to the motion. A court has referred the matter to VCAT. In my view, this is the appropriate way to proceed.
