None of the other grounds can assist the applicant, for the following reasons: The first ground reads:    (1) The Federal Magistrate and the Tribunal erred in concluding that the appellant's political activities are not sufficient to allow the appellant's case. The inference from the evidence is that the authorised recipient failed to do so, with the consequence that the applicant did not receive notice of the hearing. This is jurisdictional error. However, the affidavit also shows that the Tribunal sent to the applicant a copy of its letter to his migration agent dated 9 August 2005. I agree.
