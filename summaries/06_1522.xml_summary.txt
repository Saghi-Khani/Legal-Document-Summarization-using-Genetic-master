The Tribunal invited the appellant to attend a hearing on 9 December 2004. The Tribunal was under no obligation to send notices to the appellant's residential address, as he had indicated that all correspondence was to be sent to his migration agent. Without this further information, the Tribunal could not be satisfied that the appellant was, or would be, implicated in Falun Gong. His Honour held that he appellant could not plead fault of a migration agent as constituting jurisdictional error. The appellant was given an opportunity to comment on independent country information. The Federal Magistrate dismissed the application.
