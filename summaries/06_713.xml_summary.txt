5 The solicitor for the respondents, Mr Doble, has prepared an affidavit today setting out the basis upon which it is sought to have me make an assessment of costs thrown away by the adjournment of the hearing which has been necessitated by the circumstances I have just described. (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT)   1 The applicants yesterday raised a point which arose in the course of cross-examination towards the end of the afternoon. 9 The question of whether I should make an order for costs and in what way I should make it is obviously one which is discretionary.
