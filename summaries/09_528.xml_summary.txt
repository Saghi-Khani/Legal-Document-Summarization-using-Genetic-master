Toro Martinez v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2009] FCA 528 (21 May 2009) The Parliament enacted the 2008 amendments knowing that both the tribunal and the Courts would have made decisions affecting visas purportedly cancelled by one of the two classes of decision for which item 7 provided. However, by identifying some primary considerations and requiring the decision-maker to give weight to them, the direction emphasises that the decision-maker must have regard to those matters as a fundamental part of his or her deliberation. Mr Toro Martinez accepted that position. Fact finding is the province of the tribunal.
