45 The respondent relies upon the statements of Mr Sachs and Mr Bailey (and like statements on the part of the applicant's patent and trade mark attorneys) made to the Registrar of Trade Marks in support of the application for registration of the shape sign as a trade mark to demonstrate that the S shape distinguishes the goods: a fence dropper containing an S loop designed to catch the intermediate wires of a fence; it identifies the thing sold. That's so? Thus, s 25(1)(a) and (b) are satisfied. 93 Section 25 falls within Part 3.
