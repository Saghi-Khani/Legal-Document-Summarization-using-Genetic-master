I do not think this Court has original jurisdiction to grant an injunction restraining the second respondent from removing the applicant from Australia. This Order applies to the making of an application in relation to a migration decision (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 ) in relation to which the Court has original jurisdiction under paragraph 476A(1) (a), (b) or (c) of that Act. By paragraphs 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the SOC, the applicant purports to challenge, review, quash, and/or subject to injunction the said private clause decision(s). He is a citizen of Turkey.
