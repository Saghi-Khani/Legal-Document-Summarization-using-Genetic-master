The Supreme Court Proceeding could only have related to the Later Partnership because HCPPL was not a party to that Proceeding. The Combined Representations were warranties made by Mr Carroll and HCPPL to induce BCPL to enter into the Amended Agreement and the MoU dated 25 November 2004, and BCPL relied upon the Combined Representations in entering into the Amended Agreement and that MoU (Second Collateral Warranty Claim) [30C]. On 22 May 2008, the applicants filed a notice of motion seeking a setting aside of the order of dismissal. 599-601. Benson v Carroll [2009] FCA 1217 (28 October 2009)
