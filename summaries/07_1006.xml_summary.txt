The question that arises in the present case is whether Div 7A has the effect that payments made by Ceramics to Di Lorenzo Tile Investments Pty Limited (Tile) as trustee of a unit trust, the units in which were held as to three by Ceramics and as to the remaining one by Fresta, were to be treated as dividends paid to the respective unitholders (deemed dividends), Ceramics and Fresta respectively. 2 Each proceeding concerns assessments to income tax for the years ended 30 June 2000 and 30 June 2001. Mr Fresta and Mr Incollingo were also present.
