It appears that the impairment by way of hearing loss has deteriorated or worsened since 1 December 1988. Accordingly, there was no entitlement to receive compensation of a lump sum in relation to them under the SRC Act: s 124(3)(b) of the SRC Act. The applicant's case is that those conditions were permanent impairments that occurred in 1970. 18 Before the hearing of the application for review by the Tribunal, a report dated 8 March 2005 was obtained from Dr Michael Barnett. Conclusion  40 The application for an extension of time within which to appeal is dismissed.
