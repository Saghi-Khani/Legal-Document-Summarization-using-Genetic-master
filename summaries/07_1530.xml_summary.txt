Mr Sahade, counsel for the respondents, submitted that the fact that the offer of 27 September was made before the commencement of proceedings should not preclude the application of Calderbank principles. This finding is sufficient to enliven the Court's power to make orders under s 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and under s 72 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW). The applicant seeks to have that amount returned to him with interest (the "Applicant's Contribution Amount"). On that basis a 15% share would be worth only $135,000. I do not accept this submission.
