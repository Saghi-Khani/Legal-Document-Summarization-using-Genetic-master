Contrary to that pleaded case, Flottweg did not by the Contract assume an obligation to supply a production line which would process 5 tonnes of olives while recovering a minimum of 85% of the oil contained in the olives. The line is able to produce extra virgin olive oil. He was present at the plant on 1 and 2 May 2006. That is not to hold that Mr De Moya was dishonest in causing Olivaylle to send the letter to Flottweg in February 2006, only that he was mistaken. No one can accurately predict the success of any new product.
