Accordingly, unless the discretion of the Court otherwise orders, Brother is entitled to obtain an order against Dynamic Supplies for costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the third offer of compromise. Because I am not satisfied that these two offers were more favourable to Dynamic Supplies than the judgment on the claims to which the offers relate, I do not consider that O 23 r 11(4) is activated in relation to the first and second offers. 27 In light of the above, I find that Brother has been substantially successful on this costs application.
