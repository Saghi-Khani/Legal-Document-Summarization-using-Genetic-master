He also deposed that if risk fees were eliminated from the amount claimed and interest was charged at 12.5%, the total amount owing under the second mortgage would be around $8 million, and not $15.5 million as claimed. 14 The second issue is whether there is a serious question to be tried, that by stipulating that the applicant agree to a risk fee as a condition of the advance, the first respondent engaged in unconscionable conduct in contravention of s 12CC of the Act. The applicant submits that the balance of convenience favours the grant of the injunction.
