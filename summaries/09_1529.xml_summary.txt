Ms Macintosh has explained how she and Mr Matheson have operated the hotel business and the supermarket business from 1 April 2009 to the present day. The defendants submitted that in relation to the ongoing conduct of the two businesses by Mr Matheson there is no such serious issue to be tried. Mrs Fenlon instructed the companies' accountants to prepare the accounts for both companies as at 31 January 2009. The plaintiffs propose that the directors of the supermarket business (excluding Mr Matheson) continue to operate the supermarket business with Ms Ralph being employed as manager.
