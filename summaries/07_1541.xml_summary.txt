51 APM also sought to call upon a number of subpoenas which were directed to the issue of the restraint of Saxbys and the exercise of my discretion as to whether to order a winding up. In the appropriate case this could be ordered --- see ASIC v Eastlands Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1702. Therefore, to allow APM any further time, and await the result of the Supreme Court proceedings, would be of no consequence. In view of these factors, I propose to appoint Mr McCann as liquidator. It is conceded that there are other further supporting creditors.
