Yesterday, on 16 July 2009, the Applicant provided a detailed outline of written submissions addressing those issues canvassed on 30 June and, in particular, reasons opposing any transfer. It is considered that the proceeding should be transferred pursuant to s 32AB of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the 1976 Act) to the Federal Magistrates Court. That submission should not prevail. (3) The Rules of Court may make provision in relation to transfers of proceedings to the Federal Magistrates Court under subsection (1). The adjournment has also permitted the filing of a Defence to the Statement of Claim.
