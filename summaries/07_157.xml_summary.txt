GROUNDS OF APPEAL  16 The draft notice of appeal filed on 14 September 2006 contains five purported grounds of appeal:  1. His Honour not only considered all the grounds of appeal raised by the applicant, but also considered whether the decision contained any jurisdictional error. The Federal Magistrate asserted that the Tribunal considered the caste system in rural and urban areas and accepted that the applicant had suffered discrimination and harassment in his local area. As I have found above, the Tribunal put the independent country information to the applicant at the hearing. The Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness.
