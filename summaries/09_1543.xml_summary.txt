The Tribunal also accepted that the Appellant may face " serious harm " should he return to Singapore. This Court may permit new grounds to be raised on appeal which were not raised before the Federal Magistrates Court. This present argument is, however, without substance, again because the reasons for decision of the Tribunal accept or assume the " danger " asserted by the now Appellant. Nor does the argument articulated by the Appellant during the course of the appeal have any merit. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.
