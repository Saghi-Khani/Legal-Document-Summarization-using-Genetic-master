25 By cl 11.4, CFI undertakes, during the no-shop period, to inform Sunsuper of any competing approaches made to CFI. 2 At the first court hearing (on 17 October 2007) I made the first two orders, for the reasons that follow. As noted earlier, generally speaking the aggregate Scheme consideration is to be paid by Sunsuper to CFI to be held by CFI on trust for the Scheme shareholders. The break fee of $1 million dollars is below the 1% level. The amount of the Scheme consideration offered is $0.798 per share.
