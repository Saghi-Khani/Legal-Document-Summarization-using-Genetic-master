Senior counsel for Airservices assures the Court that the proposed settlement and the percentage of each claim that will be received by each member of the group ' is more than fair and reasonable ' to each Deacons client. Each of the remaining 33 individuals (including the applicant) signed a costs agreement with Deacons (the 'Deacons clients'). Airservices is obliged to conduct proceedings as a model litigant. Mr Balachandran is a named Deacons client. Those persons will not be bound by the proposed settlement. Both parties support an order that clause 2.1 of the Deed and amended Deed be kept confidential.
