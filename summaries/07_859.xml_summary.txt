It was a standard motor vehicle and it had not been modified in any way that related to the applicant's particular disabilities. The question before the Tribunal was whether those items of property were assets which should be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the rate of his pension within the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ("VE Act"). The Tribunal found that the motor vehicle was not specifically designed for use by a disabled person. I received the affidavit sworn on 1 June 2007, subject to arguments as to relevance.
