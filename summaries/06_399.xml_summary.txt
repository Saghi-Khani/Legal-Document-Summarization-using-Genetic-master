The proceedings were commenced in the New South Wales District Registry by an application and statement of claim filed on 1 March 2006. What Mr Gillard puts in this case as the good reason for transfer is, in his submission, the fact that the communications between the parties for the establishment of what is said to be the joint venture consists of documents which were communicated between the respondent's offices in Brisbane and the applicant's offices in the United States. The documents are located in Mr Fazzone's Sydney office.
