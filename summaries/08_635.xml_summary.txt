The tribunal member said he would be "happy to wait two weeks for any further information". His evidence dealt with his claimed membership of the MDMK. 9 While the tribunal was in error in refusing the appellant time within which to provide details of his membership of Tauhid Jamaad that error was cured by the letter of 11 December 2006. 12 For these reasons, I decline to vacate the order made on 16 November 2007. Again the appellant asked for one month. The first heading was "Inconsistencies". 10 In the event, the appellant did not take up the invitation.
