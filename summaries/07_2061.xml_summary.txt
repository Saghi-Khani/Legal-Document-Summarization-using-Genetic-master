In about March 2004, Navman, by its representative Mr Cummings, told the manager of Bulbeck that Bulbeck should not sell Navman PCN products supplied by Navman at prices less than the Whitworth's prices. Those dealers were Emjay, Alec's Marine, Hirecraft Marine, Glascraft Marine and Challenge Marine. By an email dated 9 March 2004, Mr King instructed Mr Cummimgs to ensure that Hirecraft Marine adhered to the retail prices set out in the Navman price list. 83 Mr King was aware of Mr Cummings' conversations with Mr Hurt about Navman PCN products. 45 Mr Cummings reported to Mr Baird.
