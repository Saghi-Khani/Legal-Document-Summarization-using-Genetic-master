However, it was at that point that the Crown made reference to the Natcomp matter, and errantly described the total fine in the matter at $20,000. BACKGROUND  This is an appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on the appellant, Interville, for 20 offences of copyright infringement under section 132AJ(1) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). His Honour imposed a fine of $42,000 on sequence 21. Section 16A(2) sets out a non-exhaustive list of matters which the Court is required to take into account.
