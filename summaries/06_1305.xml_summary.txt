VWAR v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs and Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1305 (4 October 2006) 7 In my view both grounds must fail. Furthermore, the Tribunal rejected the claims relating to the arms deals and fear of persecution by two government ministers. 2 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh. The appellant said that their motivation was political. Immediately thereafter the Tribunal said that it had assigned 'little evidential value' to certain documentary evidence which had been tendered by the appellant in support of his application to the Tribunal. The learned Magistrate rejected all of these contentions.
