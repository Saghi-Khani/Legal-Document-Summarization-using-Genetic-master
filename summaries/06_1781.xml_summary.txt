Sheikholeslami v Brungs [2006] FCA 1781 (20 December 2006) On 17 May 2005, the applicant filed an application (Form 5) and claim (Form 167) under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth) in the Court. His Honour referred to authority and recognised that dismissal of proceedings on either basis required considerable restraint and would be ordered sparingly. The applicant was ordered to pay the costs of the respondents on a solicitor/client basis. Upon examination, that material does not specify particular instances of discrimination in the sense used by Tamberlin J.
