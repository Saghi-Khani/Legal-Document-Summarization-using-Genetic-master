Contrary to the submission made on behalf of Mr and Mrs Cassimatis, it is not correct to state that neither Exhibit MRR1 nor Exhibit MRR2 feature in the reasons for judgement in respect of ASIC's substantive application. Save for those exhibits, it seems to me that Mr Ryan's affidavit ought to be the subject of a general grant of leave to any non-party to inspect its contents. Observation of the administration of justice is one thing; the ability freely to inspect every document on the Court's file is another.
