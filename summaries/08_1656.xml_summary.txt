The only claim BHPB brings against Cosco that is an apportionable claim under the Trade Practices Act is the claim for damages pursuant to s 82 for a contravention of s 52. Seascope also denies liability and, in the alternative, raises proportionate liability as a defence. It permits contribution from any person liable in respect of the same damage as the party seeking contribution. The action for damages for negligent misstatement is an apportionable claim by reason of the application of the Wrongs Act . The resolution of that dispute will affect the rights and obligations of BHPB and Cosco.
