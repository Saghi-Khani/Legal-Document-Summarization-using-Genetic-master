As previously indicated (at [13]) the Commissioner contends that he did address the discretion before the issue of the Notice of Amended Assessment on 29 July 2004 and that he made a decision not to remit any part of the additional tax payable by the applicant. His Honour ordered that the proceeding be dismissed. 3 Under s 170(1) of the Assessment Act the Commissioner was empowered to amend any assessment. In the circumstances, the objection decision recorded that 'penalty tax under section 226K should apply at a rate of 25% of the primary tax applicable to the adjustment'.
