Before me, Mr Doelle was concerned that the learned Federal Magistrate had not dealt with the special circumstances test correctly, in that, so he submitted, the court below had failed to appreciate that the ramification of the special circumstances test was that each case is different. There one finds express reference by the AAT to evidence summarised in para 8 of the SSAT's decision concerning economic loss. For these reasons then, in my opinion, the appeal must be dismissed. That settlement was reached following a mediation which was conducted on 29 January 2008.
