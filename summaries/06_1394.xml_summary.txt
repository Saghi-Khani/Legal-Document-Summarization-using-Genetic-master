SUBMISSIONS   13 The defendants say that evidence concerning Mr Gulson's medical condition, which is the subject of documents which have been subpoenaed and currently are the subject of orders restricting access which I made on 10 July 2006, may be deployed in these proceedings in a way that would interfere with the public interest served by Mr Gulson's giving evidence in the tobacco-related litigation now and in the future. This has already been exposed in open court. The possible cases where an order may be necessary to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice range fairly widely.
