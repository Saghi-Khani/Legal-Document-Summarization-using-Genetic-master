3 In the course of argument today, Mr Stevenson SC for ASIC modified the terms of the orders that he seeks, apparently because he wishes to confine the right to cross-examine the witnesses only in relation to the meeting that took place on the evening on 19 August 2005 which is described in [29] to [36] of the further amended statement of claim. 7 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2006] NSWSC 643 ; (2006) 201 FLR 207 at [9] , Austin J said that in his opinion s 26 of the Evidence Act is subject to s 192.
