On 26 May last year Dowsett J made an order that the Applicant show cause at the next directions hearing why the application should not be dismissed pursuant to s 190F(6) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (Native Title Act). Defaults of appearance, in themselves, provide a basis upon which an application may be dismissed. I canvassed the background to that particular provision in the legislation in a decision which I gave in another case: Christie George on behalf of the Gurambilbarra People v State of Queensland [2008] FCA 1518.
