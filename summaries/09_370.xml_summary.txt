By interlocutory process dated 24 March 2009, the Plaintiffs moved the Court for an order that they have leave to use the documents, produced pursuant to subpoenas issued in this proceeding, in proceedings to be commenced, pursuant to Part 5.9 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ("the Act") for examination and ancillary orders. The documents produced by public regulatory authorities are ownership records relating to particular motor vehicles. The First and Second Defendants neither object nor consent to the making of the order. There has been no recorded response from VicRoads, which is the remaining third party.
