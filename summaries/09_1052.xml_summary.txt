Paragraph 44 alleges that, in breach of a term pleaded in para 25(o), upon termination of the applicant's employment, the respondent did not pay the applicant 12 months' salary or any redundancy payments. At the very least, the applicant's claim pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act can be taken to include a contention to this effect, which the Court would have to resolve. Based on the statutory entitlements to annual leave, I am of the view that a prima facie case is made out for the claims in paras 2 and 3 of the amended application.
