For these reasons I consider that the Court's jurisdiction in relation to the present appeal should be exercised by a Full Court: see Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), s 25(1AA)(b). 3 By application filed on 19 June 2007, the applicant sought leave to appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrate. "  Before the orders could be entered the Minister, by Notice of Motion dated 19 November 2007, moved the Court for an order that the orders made on 2 November 2007 be set aside. The Minister was represented by a solicitor. I will so order.
