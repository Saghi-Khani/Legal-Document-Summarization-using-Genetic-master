First, in relation to the first ground of appeal, his Honour dealt comprehensively with the issue of whether the appellants were members of a particular social group (or had indeed raised this issue before the Tribunal) in his judgment at [36]-[52]. The appellants sought judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal in the Federal Magistrates Court. In this case the Tribunal found that the appellants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution. Once that finding is made, the appellants are not "refugees". Background The appellants are a husband and wife, and are citizens of India.
