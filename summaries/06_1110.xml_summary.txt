The Tribunal was entitled to rely upon the documents which were before it. 27 As a second ground, the appellant says the Federal Magistrates Court erred in rejecting the ground of appeal which alleged errors in the translation of the appellant's original statement. However, Smith FM noted that the transcript of the Tribunal proceedings had not been tendered, despite the fact that the appellant had been on notice that it would be required to prove his claims. The reasons for that termination have not been given. I agree. Accordingly, the decision could be sustained on a separate ground.
