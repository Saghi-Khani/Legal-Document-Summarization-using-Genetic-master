The land at the time the sale to Mr Patmore was completed, was valued at $600,000 if sold in separate lots. Mr Kitto has no recollection of the conversation on this day. Mr Upton says that "until then I had believed Mr Kittto to be truthful when he told me that he would contact me before (the respondent) signed the contract, if they signed it at all". 2 Mr Upton defaulted under the mortgage. 33 On 1 April Mr Upton telephoned Mr Kitto. My offer will be substantially more than $80,000 to pay you out.
