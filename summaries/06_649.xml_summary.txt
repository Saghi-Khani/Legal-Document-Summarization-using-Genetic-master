4 Section 300 of the Act provides for automatic continuation of a registered migration agent's registration in certain circumstances. 59 Section 300(4)(b) and (c) therefore deal with the situation where the MARA decides, during the period of deemed continuation of registration (but before the grant of any application for registration), to suspend or cancel the agent's registration. The MARA's decision was affirmed by the AAT in January 2006. Application for registration must then be made annually. 21 Division 3 of Part 3 concerns the registration of persons as migration agents.
