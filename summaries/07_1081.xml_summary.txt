This case was fixed for hearing and commenced on Monday 16 July 2007. For example, counsel for the applicant relied heavily upon the decision of Austin J in Sovereign Motor Inns Pty Ltd v Bevillesta Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 521 in which privilege was maintained, notwithstanding inspection of the document by the other side. "  I would normally follow such a recent and considered decision of a judge of the Court. The issue of inadvertent disclosure of privileged documents arises yet again. The solicitor responsible for handing over the documents in question gave evidence which was not challenged.
