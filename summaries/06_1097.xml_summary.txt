Although the Australian Taxation Office initially indicated its objection to the application, that was before the taxation returns and BAS statements had been lodged. Sequestration orders were made in respect of the estate of each of the applicants on 29 May 2006. On the basis of Mr Carter's evidence, I find that the assets of the Hawthornes at all material times well exceeded that of their liabilities. The stock (sheep) on their farm is valued at about $97,000. Lyall Pfeiffer and Mrs J Pfeiffer are creditors of the Hawthornes. Mr Hawthorne has not however cashed the refund cheque.
