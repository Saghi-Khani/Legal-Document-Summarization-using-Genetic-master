Section 37(4) refers to unfairness or unreasonableness that the Tribunal has determined to exist in relation to the trustee's decision that is the subject of the complaint. The Tribunal concluded that Jill Teeling should receive 22% of the death benefit. (2) Was any complaint made about Olive Webb's share? The Tribunal is not so satisfied. This argument is untenable. The submissions on Rebecca's behalf asserted that the Tribunal erred in law in concluding that Olive Webb was not Christopher's dependant at the relevant time. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.
