The circumstances in which leave to administer interrogatories would be allowed were considered in Hall v Truman, Hanbury, & Co (1885) 29 Ch D 307. When the court was satisfied that a party might have other relevant documents, it could order a further affidavit confined to the particular documents believed to have been omitted ( Vyse v Foster (1872) LR 13 Eq 602) or a further general affidavit ( Saull v Browne (1874) LR 17 Eq 402). The priority dates of the patents in suit are 19 July 1993. Particular discovery is sought of these documents. The second goes against the applicant.
