The expression 'transfer of property' is given an extended meaning by s 120(7)(b) BA. 10 Central to the applicant's claim against these respondents is the pleading that Mr Spencer at all times acted on the instructions and at the direction of the bankrupt. 6 Section 120(1) provides in substance that a transfer of property by a person who later becomes bankrupt to another a person is void against the trustee in bankruptcy if it took place within 5 years of the bankruptcy (as this transfer did) and if there was insufficient consideration or no consideration.
