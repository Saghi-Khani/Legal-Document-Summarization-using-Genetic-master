The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the application made to that Court: SZIAI v Minister for Immigration [2008] FMCA 788. 15 The Tribunal proceeded to accept the evidence provided by the Association. 26 Whether or not it is unreasonable not to make further inquiries may well depend upon the availability of further information and its importance to the factual issues to be resolved. That submission was resisted by Counsel for the Respondent Minister. The appeal be allowed. This was an argument raised before the Federal Magistrates Court and resolved against the now Appellant.
