75 Bell IXL put some emphasis upon Mr Milne's evidence of needing to 'stabilise the register' of LFE as supporting the allegation of improper purpose. Further, there was some discussion in relation to seeking capital raising by share allotment prior to May 2008. • On 31 March 2008 the LFE directors' meeting was attended by Messrs Bellman and Milne. • On 9 June 2008 Aegis confirmed it would take a 15% placement in LFE. I will return to the Booth meeting and Booth email later. • On 23 May 2008 Bell IXL lodged a Notice of Initial Substantial Shareholder with the ASX.
