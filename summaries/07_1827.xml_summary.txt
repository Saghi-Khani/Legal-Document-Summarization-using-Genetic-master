1 The applicant, Mr Horn, has been concerned for some time that the construction and lay-out of polling booths used in federal elections do not adequately screen him from observation by others while he is in the process of marking his ballot-paper. 4 In 2006 Mr Horn instituted proceedings in this Court seeking relief against the Commission in respect of this alleged non-compliance with the Electoral Act . Essentially Mr Horn contends that the voting compartment should have a door, screen or curtain on the front of it to screen the voter.
