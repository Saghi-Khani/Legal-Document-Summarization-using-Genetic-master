The 2005 tax return annexed to Mr Armenti's affidavit records that it was signed by Mr Armenti on 24 February 2006 and signed but not dated by Mr Gilmour (page 71). Those Management Fees are not recorded in the 2005 financial statements annexed to the applicant' s 9 November 2006 affidavit. The financial statements and tax returns for those years provided to the applicant are in significant respects different to those produced in this proceeding by the respondent. Accordingly my findings on the issues of good faith and proper purpose relate to both equally.
