1 On 17 March 2006 the applicant filed an application in the High Court of Australia seeking an extension of time within which to apply to show cause why the constitutional writs should not issue in relation to a decision made by Brigadier C J Appleton, as the delegate of the Chief of Army, on 3 November 2004. The notice of appeal was out of time and on 15 August 2001 Heerey J refused an application to extend time to file the appeal. The applicant seems to challenge the conviction of the Defence Force Magistrate in these proceedings.
