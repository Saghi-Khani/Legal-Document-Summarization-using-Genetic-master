I decided that the Austal 94 hull form infringed Stena's patent, but that the Austal 196 and Austal 285 hull forms did not. SUBMISSIONS  5 Stena seeks an order that Austal pay all of its costs of the proceedings. 4 By Orders 7, 8 and 9, I directed the parties to file written submissions on the question of costs, and noted that it would be determined on the papers. Stena Rederi Aktiebolag v Austal Ships Sales Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1141 (10 August 2007) 13 In this case, I consider it appropriate to apportion the costs to some extent.
