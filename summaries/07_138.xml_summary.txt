I have already mentioned that the Tribunal wrote to the appellant on 13 April 2005 inviting the appellant to comment on the refusal of Shark Australia's application for a nomination and the appellant responded, albeit briefly, on 19 May 2005. Section 338 provides for those decisions which are reviewable as MRT-reviewable decisions. One of the criteria to be satisfied for the grant of the visa was that a 'nomination' in respect of the occupational training had been approved by the Minister: Schedule 2 Item 442.222(1) Migration Regulations 1994 . 38  The appeal must be dismissed.
