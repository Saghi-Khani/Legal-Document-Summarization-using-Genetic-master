6 The first and second respondents submitted that the indemnity costs were appropriate because the applicant's conduct went beyond unreasonable and was found to be fraudulent. Salfinger v Niugini Mining (Australia) Pty Ltd (No 4) [2007] FCA 1594 (18 October 2007) Kenny J considered the competing interests in determining whether to make an award of indemnity costs against a self-represented litigant. 10 I order that the applicant pay the costs of the respondents, including reserved costs, on an indemnity basis. In my view an appeal would have no reasonable prospects of success.
