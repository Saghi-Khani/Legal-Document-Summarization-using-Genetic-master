THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE  10 Before the federal magistrate the appellant relied upon his amended application filed on 1 December 2006 which raised four grounds of appeal. Firstly, the appellant asserted the Tribunal did not consider the country information that stated it was possible for Jehovah's Witnesses who refuse military service to be detained. Even if the Tribunal had the additional information before it, any response, in my view, would not have affected the Tribunal's finding about the credit-worthiness of the appellant. Currently there are no Jehovah's Witnesses imprisoned in Russia for this reason.
