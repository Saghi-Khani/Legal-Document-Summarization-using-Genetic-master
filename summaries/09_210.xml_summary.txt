The Refugee Review Tribunal's decision was illogical, unsupported by probative material and the inference of fact upon which it based its decision could not reasonably be drawn when it concluded that the appellant's short visit to Pakistan before travelling to Australia caused the Tribunal to doubt he engaged in homosexual conduct in the UAE or that he was genuinely fearful of persecution in Pakistan. On 16 August 2007 he lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The applicant's first ground of appeal therefore fails. You then returned to Pakistan.
