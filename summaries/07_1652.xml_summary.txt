The Tribunal had considered the claim as an ethnic Chinese and as a Chinese Christian and considered the cumulative effects. On 19 September 2005 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant had a well-founded fear of Convention-related persecution arising from the Indonesian authorities' response to other forms of harm. For these reasons, his Honour correctly rejected the first ground. SZIJG v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1652 (30 October 2007)
