The person to be replaced is no longer authorised by the claim group to make the application and to deal with matters arising in relation to it. 27 A decision of the native title claim group is required by ss 66B(1)(a)(i) to remove the current applicant's authority (see Daniel 194 ALR 278 at [15]). It was brought by Arthur Que Noy, Gabriel Hazelbane, Paddy Huddleston and Marjorie Foster on behalf of the Wagiman, Warai and Kamu peoples as the native title claim group. No such application was made. Marjorie Foster has 11 children, including Margaret Foster.
