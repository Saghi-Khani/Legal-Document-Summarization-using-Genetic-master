ISSUES ARISING UNDER S 170C  68 Counsel for TWS submit that the 2007 controlled action decision and the 2007 assessment approach decision are invalid because Gunns did not withdraw the second referral in accordance with s 170C of the EPBC Act. (2) The referral cannot be withdrawn after the Minister has decided, under Part 9, whether or not to approve the taking of the action. 14 Section 87(5) is headed " Assessment on preliminary documentation ". Mr Early said that, based on his experience and judgment, he favoured this form of assessment for the proposed action. 145 I reject those submissions.
