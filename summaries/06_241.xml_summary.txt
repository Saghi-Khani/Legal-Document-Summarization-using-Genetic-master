1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of Bennett J given and made on 4 November 2005, whereby her Honour refused an application for an order nisi in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal handed down on 20 September 2000. In particular no viable submission was made to me demonstrative of any error of law in her Honour's approach or reasoning, either in the applicant's written submissions filed on 3 March 2006 or otherwise in oral address. 5 The application for leave must therefore be dismissed with costs.
