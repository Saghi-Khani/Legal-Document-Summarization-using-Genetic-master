The third respondent, Mr Peril, took up employment with the second respondent. At the time of the merger the first applicant and the first respondent agreed that the first respondent would change its name from Andrew Young & Associates Pty Ltd to United Insurance Advisers (National) Pty Ltd. Essentially, the combined database contained client and policy details from both businesses. The first applicant contributed information from its database of approximately 1000 clients. In my view, the evidence does not make out a case for the grant of injunctive relief that would restrain the very limited ongoing use of this name.
