APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL INTERLOCUTORY DECISION  This is an application filed by the applicant on 22 May 2009 seeking leave to appeal from the orders of a Federal Magistrate who dismissed the applicant's application in the Federal Magistrates Court pursuant to r 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth) (Rules) on the ground that her application did not raise an arguable case for the relief claimed. The Tribunal asked why the applicant could not relocate to another part of China. A perusal of the Tribunal's decision record does not indicate any such difficulty.
