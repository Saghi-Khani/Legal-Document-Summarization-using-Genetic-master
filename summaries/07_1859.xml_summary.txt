1 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ("ACCC") has applied to the Court for declarations, injunctions, pecuniary penalties and other relief in relation to 10 separate acts of resale price maintenance engaged in by the first respondent, TEAC Australia Pty Ltd ("TEAC"), in contravention of s 48 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Act "). AGREED FACTS  3 It is convenient and useful to set out the summary of contravening conduct in the Joint Submissions. The parties have also filed minutes of consent orders. I wouldn't want to see prices advertised in any media below the go price.
