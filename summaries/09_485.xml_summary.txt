A taxpayer, said Mr Romano, was entitled to act within his or her rights in not providing documentation and information when requested to do so by the Australian Taxation Office prior to the disallowance of a notice of objection. The Australian Taxation Office granted a further extension of time until 12 January 2007. First, I deal with Mr Romano's contention in relation to the exercise of the discretion as to costs in tax cases. However, the taxpayer produced no documents before the audit ended in May 2006. This was because Mr Uratoriu had since 1992 been suffering from depression.
