I believe that this decision was unreasonable and the tribunal failed to consider relevant considerations. In my view, the second Tribunal decision does not evince any jurisdictional error. 24 The doctrine of res judicata therefore, in my view, clearly applies. On 11 March 2002 the appellant sought judicial review of the second Tribunal decision in the Federal Court. The Judge erred in not concluding that the RRT made an erroneous finding. (Page 6). However, I do not think it is appropriate to determine the present application by reference to those difficulties.
