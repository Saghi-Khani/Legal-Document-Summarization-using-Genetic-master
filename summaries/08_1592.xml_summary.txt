First, as I noted in the quantum judgment, Camerons should, as a prima facie matter, be liable for the whole of the costs related to breach of confidence because Vawdrey was not a party to that claim: [2008] FCA 1493 at [65] . Vawdrey should be liable for the remaining one-third of the copyright costs (and thus one-sixth of the overall costs). Similarly, I cannot award costs against Krueger on the basis that Krueger refused to provide copies of documents directly rather than by inspection and upon written request. COSTS OF LIABILITY HEARING: INDEMNITY OR PARTY-PARTY?
