The reason the Federal Court made this declaration is that the catalogues advertised the 17 items of jewellery as having a "Was" price and a "Now" price in circumstances where we had not offered the items of jewellery for sale at the "Was" price for a reasonable period immediately prior to the catalogue promotions. 9 The first question is whether an injunction should issue at all. Plainly, proposed order 1 does not reflect findings of liability in the sense of declaring the conduct of Prouds that was in contravention of the Act. Three months, in my opinion, is appropriate.
