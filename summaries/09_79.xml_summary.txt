I see no reason for criticism of the Tribunal's consideration of Dr Banks' report and Mr Murdoch's report, or of the way the Tribunal came to a conclusion based upon those reports, together with Mr Aporo's own evidence and submissions, to determine the likelihood of recidivism. The decision to cancel his visa was affirmed by the second Tribunal on 18 July 2008. CONCLUSION  Mr Aporo has failed to establish any of the grounds of his application. Mr Aporo's submissions to the first Tribunal centred on his history and family relationships.
