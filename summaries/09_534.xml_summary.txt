On 9 July 2008, the State established the terms of reference of the Investigation. The sole issue is whether the release of the s 63 information to the Panel is for the purposes of the 1969 State Act or Regulations. In the case of offshore petroleum mining operations, the 1969 State Act will apply to only one component of a larger operation in one part of a pipeline running from an offshore production facility to the Western Australian mainland. On 2 April 2009, Apache provided to the State documents in response to the 1 April 2009 Notice. I agree.
