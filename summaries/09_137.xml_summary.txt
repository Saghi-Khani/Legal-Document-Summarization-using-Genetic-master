That was why I set the matter down for hearing on 30 March 2008. First, valuation evidence in relation to the Cadetta tenements. The defendants oppose leave being granted. There was some delay in Piper Alderman obtaining the plaintiff's file from the former solicitors and the file was not obtained until 5 January 2009. Nevertheless, the indulgence will have the effect of vacating the hearing date. I would not grant leave to the applicants generally to issue subpoenas. The valuation evidence which is sought to be adduced relates only to the alternative basis upon which the claim is made.
