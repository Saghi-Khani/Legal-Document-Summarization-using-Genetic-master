10 The Federal Magistrate observed that the new ground had not been specifically raised in the earlier proceedings before Sackville J. Applicant S105/2003 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 639 (9 May 2006) That decision was the subject of a review application to the Refugee Review Tribunal ('Tribunal'). 13 I have also considered the arguments raised by the appellant in his outline of submissions filed in this Court. In the circumstances, I will make an order that the appellant pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal.
