On 16 February 2009, the applicant filed an Application for Extension of Time to File and Serve a Notice of Appeal in order to enable him to appeal from the decision of Cowdroy J made on 4 November 2008 ( the present application). In my view, no " special reasons " exist for the grant of leave sought in this case. On the same day, his Honour delivered his reasons for making those orders. The points raised by the applicant involve only the interpretation of the Federal Court Act. No notices pursuant to that section ought to have been given by the applicant.
