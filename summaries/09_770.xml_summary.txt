The first item in the draft bill of costs is for "additional work done to date". While I accept that uniformity is a consideration, the fact that the applicant and the third respondent have agreed and consented to an order being made up to the point of mediation, should not be considered determinative or necessarily the primary factor in assessing the stage for security which should now be provided. However, as noted above, for the next stage the respondents estimate $42,000.00. There is a related item 14 dealing with disbursements for expert fees totalling $150,000.00.
