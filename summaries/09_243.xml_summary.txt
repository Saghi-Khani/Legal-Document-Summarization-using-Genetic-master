In Draffin v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2007] FCA 2011 , Ryan J ordered that penalties be imposed on Walton for breaches arising from what occurred on 16 November 2005. Mr Allen told the meeting that he had been directed by Mr Benstead not to allow Monjon to perform traffic management services. They were also "building industry participant(s)" for the purposes of s 4 of the BCII Act. Whether there had been similar previous conduct by the respondent. Whether senior management was involved in the breaches. However, according to the totality principle it must attract some meaningful penalty.
