2 Mrs Baccon first came to Australia in 1988. In particular, I find that the Tribunal misconstrued s 7(3) of the Act and failed to have regard to the matters identified in s 7(3) for the purpose of deciding whether Mrs Baccon at the time of her application for an age pension had 10 years qualifying Australian residence. In determining whether a person had 10 years qualifying Australian residence, the decision-maker must have regard to the nature of the accommodation used by the person in Australia over the whole of the period on which reliance is placed.
