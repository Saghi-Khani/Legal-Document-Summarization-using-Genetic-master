The Tribunal correctly found that the appellant only achieved seven passes/exemptions out of the 17 subjects that he undertook during the 2001 academic year. 5 At the time of his application, the last visa held by the appellant was a subclass 560 visa, which was valid for the period 15 August 2000 to 15 March 2002. The appellant attended the hearing and gave oral evidence. But in any event, whatever the practice of RMIT might be, condition 8202 requires that the visa holder achieve an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory.
