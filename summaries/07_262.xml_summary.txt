Moore and Finn JJ dismissed the appeal in respect of the 15 April Order on the ground that it was an order made by a docket judge and a matter of practice and procedure involving the exercise of the discretion so that an appellate court should exercise caution in setting such order aside. I should follow the reasoning of the Full Court. On 6 July 2005 French J granted leave to appeal from the 15 April Order. On 9 December 2005 the applicant sought special leave to appeal the decision of the Full Federal Court to the High Court.
