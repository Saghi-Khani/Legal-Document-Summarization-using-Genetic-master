On that finding, the persecution she feared was not for a Convention reason --- the Tribunal member rejected the hypothesis that the appellant was attacked because she was Chinese. The appellant argued that the Tribunal's reasoning reveals no consideration of whether effective state protection was available to the appellant 'on the ground' or at a 'micro' level, as was required: the question was, what would be available as a practical matter to a woman in the position of the appellant? The Tribunal further accepted that 'ethnic Chinese women' in Indonesia are a particular social group within the Convention's meaning.
