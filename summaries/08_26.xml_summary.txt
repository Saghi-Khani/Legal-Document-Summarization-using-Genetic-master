Paragraph 22.1 asserts money transfers as part of a scheme put in place by Waters with an intent to defraud creditors. 17 Mr Lynch says that it is not sufficient to simply plead a reduction in the assets available to future creditors or an intention to defraud simply by reference to future creditors. 27 Accordingly, the application for an extension of time for leave to appeal the interlocutory judgment of 6 December 2007 is refused and the application for leave to appeal is refused. The contention is this. The Notice of Motion was filed on 2 January 2008.
