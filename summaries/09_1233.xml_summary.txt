TRIBUNAL'S FINDINGS  The Tribunal's reasoning is found at paragraphs [61] to [78] of its decision record. By letter dated 19 February 2009, the Tribunal invited the appellant to give evidence and present arguments before it at a hearing to be held on 1 April 2009. The appellant does not pursue any of the grounds of review in his application to the Federal Magistrates Court in this appeal. The police arrested all the activists, including the appellant. It was not obliged to consider whether those findings might be wrong. His claims are set out in his protection visa application.
