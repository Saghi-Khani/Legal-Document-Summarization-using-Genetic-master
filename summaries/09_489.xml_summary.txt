On 13 October 2008 the liquidator obtained an order under s 596B of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for the issue of a summons requiring Mr Mason to attend and be examined about the affairs of Australvic. I did, however, impose two restrictions on the liquidator. I have looked at my reasons for dismissing Mr Mason's application to set aside the examination summons. Second, I directed that without leave of the court, any evidence given by Mr Mason could not be used, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Supreme Court proceeding. On 12 March 2009 the examination commenced.
