In their application before the Federal Magistrates Court, the appellants raised the following matters for consideration: (a) Whether the Tribunal applied the wrong test in relation to State protection. (i) The Tribunal, while accepting that the first appellant was a supporter of the UNP and had participated in minor ways in a number of election campaigns, found that this involvement did not lead to a finding that the chance that he would be persecuted for his political opinion, now or in the reasonably foreseeable future, was real. Only the first appellant made substantive protection claims. This ground also fails.
