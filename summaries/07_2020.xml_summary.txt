The administration of the estates of deceased persons in bankruptcy is dealt with by Pt XI of the Act. Legal ownership of the shares is held by Equity Trust Limited which administers the companies in question from its Jersey office. 5 No forms of request are prescribed and there are no Regulations or Rules of Court setting out any procedural requirements. 3 So far as the Trustee is aware, no application has been made for a grant of probate of any will of the deceased. The reasons for that order follow. The present case is somewhat out of the ordinary.
