The Administrators' letter asserted that it followed that Vopak was not entitled to sell any plant and equipment, in particular the Biodiesel Plant, without the consent of the Administrators and of Lurgi. Clause 9 of the proposed asset sale agreement between Vopak and the Buyer is as follows:  9. I am satisfied on the evidence that since 30 January 2009, NFD has not had a right to enter upon the Premises and remove its fixtures. I proceed on the basis that Vopak determined the Sublease in accordance with its terms on 4 October 2008.
