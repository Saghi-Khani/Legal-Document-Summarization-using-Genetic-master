18 In June 2004 Exact proposed to Hume that it acquire Hume's business, which would be merged with that of ESA. This was done by obtaining details of Hume's customers on the portal. Mr Urand stated that ESA opposes the orders sought by Hume. Where the distributorship becomes successful, according to Hume's case, Exact moves in after a three-to-five-year establishment period and takes over the distributorship. The terms "Relevant Person" and "Distributorship Agreement" will be defined as set out in the notice of motion. Article 20(2) provides for termination by Exact for cause.
