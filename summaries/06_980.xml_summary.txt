15 Subject to the following qualification, I would also order that the fourth respondent pay 20% of the costs of the proceeding. I also noted, and counsel for Nokia agreed, that the third and fourth respondents were alleged to have engaged in a lower volume of infringing conduct than the first and second respondents. Accordingly, the fourth respondent should not bear the applicant's costs of preparing evidence of sales of counterfeit products after 24 February 2006. " I ordered that the parties file written submissions on costs. In this case, I have ordered summary judgment against the respondents.
