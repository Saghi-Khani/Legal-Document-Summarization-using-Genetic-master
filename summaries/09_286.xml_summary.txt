According to the Commissioner, in order for the applicant to be entitled to deduct from her assessable income any loss or outgoing, including self-education expenses, the outgoings must have been incurred in the course of gaining or producing assessable income. The applicant submitted that this was not relevant in determining whether the applicant's self-education expenses were incidental and relevant to the derivation of her Youth Allowance income. It is sufficient that the expenditure was incurred as a necessary incident of deriving the Youth Allowance. '   Accordingly, the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the Commissioner.
