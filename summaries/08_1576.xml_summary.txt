Further to paragraphs 7, 8, 9 10 and 11, the respondent purported to raise amended assessments in respect of the applicant for each of the relevant years by purporting to include in the applicant's assessable income amounts by way of deemed dividend in reliance on section 108 ITAA 36 and Division 7A ITAA 36. Further to paragraph 18, the respondent did not determine whether the company had any distributable surplus for the years of income ended 30 June 1997 --- 2005 inclusive. However, neither of these matters is sufficient to challenge the validity of the assessments.
