These reasons concern an application by Mr Soh for an extension of time and leave to appeal against orders of Moore J made on 14 October 2008 requiring Mr Soh to provide security for costs in a form acceptable to the Commonwealth in an amount of $30,000 by 4.00 pm on 14 December 2008, and a consequential order that if the applicant did not comply then the proceedings should be dismissed. There is no doubt that the Court has power to make contingent self-executing orders that in the event of non-compliance the matter stands dismissed.
