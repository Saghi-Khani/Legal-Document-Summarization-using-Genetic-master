(3) The Tribunal also notes that even though the applicant claims that the authorities detained him for 10 days after 1999 because of his association with Falun Gong, he was not subject to any persecution after his release. 2 The appellant appeals to this Court and raises these grounds of appeal:   (1) The Tribunal failed to consider my claims for my application for a protection visa. He said that as a result of those protests he was subsequently arrested. The appellant says that his child in China has been persecuted.
