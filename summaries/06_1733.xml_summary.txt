There was no reason for her to wait for authentication of the order of Phipps FM before appealing. "  2 I understand the proposed relief to be a request for the Court to extend the time within which Ms Zegarac is allowed to appeal from the judgment of Federal Magistrate Phipps of 16 December 2005. During the proceeding, Ms Zegarac applied for leave to file a counterclaim alleging professional negligence against Mr Dellios. His Honour, Cashmore M heard the matter. In that judgment Phipps FM dismissed Ms Zegarac's application to set aside a bankruptcy notice dated 18 July 2005.
