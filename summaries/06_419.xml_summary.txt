Proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court  11 The appellant appeared in person in the Federal Magistrates Court. In these contentions, he stated that, although the initial cause of his problems for his difficulties was his debt, the money lenders will use their political affiliations to harm him. The RRT considered these claims and found that there was no relevant connection between the persecution the appellant feared and any Convention reason, including persecution on the ground of political opinion. The appellant now appeals from that decision. I can discern no error in his Honour's judgment in this regard.
