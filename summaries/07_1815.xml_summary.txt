1 On 7 November 2007 I found that Mr Siminton had committed contempt of Court by failing to pay a fine imposed on him by a Full Court within the time stipulated by the Full Court (which included an additional two weeks allowed by the District Registrar under the Full Court's Order): see Australian Prudential Regulation Authority v Siminton (No 8) [2007] FCA 1612. The extended period expired on 2 October 2006. 12 Counsel for Mr Siminton advised the Court that Mr Siminton proposes to file an appeal against my contempt finding and any penalty which I might impose.
