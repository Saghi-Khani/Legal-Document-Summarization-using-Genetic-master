CPA Australia Ltd v Dunn [2007] FCA 1966 (12 December 2007) THE CURRENT PROCEEDINGS  11 The applicant contends that any use by Mr Dunn in his general letterhead and promotional materials of the two descriptions "Certified Practising Accountant" and "Certified Public Accountant" would contravene ss 52 and 53 (c) and (d) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ("the Trade Practices Act "). That would still be likely to mislead or deceive. That term closely resembles the designation "Certified Practising Accountant". However, he is not a "Certified Public Accountant" because no professional body or organisation has conferred that title upon him.
