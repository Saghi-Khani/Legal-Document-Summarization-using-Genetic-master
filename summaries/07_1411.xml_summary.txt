KGL Health Pty Limited v Mechtler [2007] FCA 1411 (12 September 2007) 11 Rosanza submits that the correct construction of clause 11 is that it relates only to physical damage or destruction , and that the carrying out of the works and alterations is not damage or destruction which renders the premises unfit for reasonable occupation. On one view, this could be construed as a defence of set-off. 4 In paragraph 1 of the Defence to the Amended Cross-Claim, the cross-respondents admit that they are in breach of the Lease because Peninsula failed to pay the above amount.
