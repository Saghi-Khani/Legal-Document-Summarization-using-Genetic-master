I will, however, consider further Mr Priestley's submissions regarding the application of the Human Rights Act to this Court. I reject the general proposition that the fact that a judge is a rule making judge or has applied s 31A of the Act gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The hearing of the constitutional issue will proceed today. Accordingly, this application for recusal is refused. 5 Mr Priestley presses his application for an adjournment, on the basis that he has filed an application in the High Court. He submits that I made an error of law.
