Background to the respondent's application before Federal Magistrate Coker  9 On 20 June 2003, the Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Ms Townsend. [30] I intend to fix the trustee's costs in relation to the administration of the estate at $15,000.00 taking into consideration the amounts already paid and the estimates contained within the correspondence of 10 February 2004. The Bankruptcy Act requires trustees to automatically provide certain details of receipts and payments (including remuneration). The trustee had rejected Ms Townsend's assessment of those matters.
