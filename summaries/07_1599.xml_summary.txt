17 The only claim made by the applicant that might possibly suggest jurisdictional error on the part of the AAT is his assertion that the AAT failed to take into account his relationship with Ms Tran and her children. REASONING  11 The AAT's decision is a ' privative clause decision ' for the purposes of the Migration Act : see ss 474(2) , 500 (1)(b), 501 (1). 7 On 20 March 2007, the Minister's delegate cancelled the applicant's visa and shortly thereafter the applicant was taken into immigration detention. The ' appeal ' must therefore be dismissed, with costs.
