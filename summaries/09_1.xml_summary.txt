The Scheme was based on an actuarial report dated 26 September 2008 (First Joint Report) prepared jointly by the appointed actuaries of NMLA and Challenger, respectively Mr Michael Thornton and Mr Anthony Bofinger. Background Both NMLA and Challenger are registered life insurance companies. Under the Scheme for which confirmation is sought it is proposed to transfer specified NMLA Australian immediate annuity policies from SF4 to Challenger's SF2. In the updated report annexed to his affidavit of 24 November 2008 Mr Thornton expressed similar views about the nature of Enterprise Capital Reserves. These complaints and objections are discussed below.
