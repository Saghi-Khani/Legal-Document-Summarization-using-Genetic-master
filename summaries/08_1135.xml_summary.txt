In those circumstances, in action NSD 124 of 2006, I order that the plaintiff pay the first defendant's costs of, and incidental to, preparation for trial, incurred after 7 February 2008 and prior to 11 March 2008. 34 The plaintiffs also seek, by reference to earlier decisions, to establish that under general principles of admiralty law, a vessel under tow is vicariously liable for damage done by the tug. At some time thereafter Adsteam was joined. We're the successful party and costs would follow the event. I then heard the plaintiffs' motions as against Giant Marine.
