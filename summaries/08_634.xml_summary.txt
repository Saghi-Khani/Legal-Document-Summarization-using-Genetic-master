Such an application must be filed within 28 days from the date of judgment: see Pt 41 r 41.02.1 of the High Court Rules. Such orders are made to preserve the subject matter of any appeal. The Minister seeks this order on the basis that publication of the Full Court's reasons (or the transcript or written submissions relating to the proceeding) would adversely impact the Minister's ability to obtain relevant information and thereby properly discharge his functions under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). On Wednesday 30 April 2008, such an application was made.
