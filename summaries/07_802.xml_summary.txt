46 The Tribunal recognised the appellant's claims to fear persecution on the grounds of religion, both by general discrimination against Buddhists and by reason of his religious and social welfare activities as a Buddhist monk. The written submissions contained a statement which expressly referred to the appellant's statement attached to her protection visa application. The information therefore fell within s 424A(3)(b) so that s 424A(1) was not enlivened. The appellant expressly stated the date of her arrival in Australia to the tribunal at the hearing. INTRODUCTION  1 The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh.
