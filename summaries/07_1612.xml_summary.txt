7 By notice of motion dated 15 December 2006 the District Registrar sought orders that Mr Siminton be committed to prison or otherwise punished for contempt of Court for failing to pay the fine imposed by the Full Court. On that day he used the card to pay $2,000 to his solicitor. Counsel for Mr Siminton did not so submit. Proceeding number 1607 of 2005 is the file number assigned to the principal proceeding in which the ex parte orders of Sundberg J were made. I was not referred to any authority which would require me to disqualify myself.
