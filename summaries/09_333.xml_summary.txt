None of the cross-claimants were a party to the winding up proceedings so cannot be bound in that capacity. Unlike issue estoppel which requires an identity of parties, an abuse of process may prevent a person from making a collateral attack on a judgment in an action with a different party. The cross-claimants contend that each group company was solvent prior to the commencement by ASIC of its application to wind up two group members, Ann Street and York Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (York Street). I will refuse leave to amend the cross-claim. Nor did Mr Martin.
