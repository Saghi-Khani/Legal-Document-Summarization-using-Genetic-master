The matter was eventually argued at length, limited to the cross-examination question. He was unsuccessful and then appealed to this Court. Mr Knackstredt, who appeared for the first respondent (the "Minister") also offered substantial assistance. 3 I am now considering the question of costs. 4 However the present case is in a different category. The application was unsuccessful and, on 7 May 2004, he applied to the second respondent ("the Tribunal") for review of that decision. The appellant naturally resists such an order. So-called "pro bono" work is done "pro bono publico", that is "for the public good".
