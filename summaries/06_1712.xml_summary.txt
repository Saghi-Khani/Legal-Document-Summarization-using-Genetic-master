Mr Daniel was not cross-examined. INTRODUCTION  1 On 13 November 2006 the applicants filed a notice of motion seeking production and forensic examination of computers and back up material, including hard drives, in the possession of the respondents. However, he made no enquiries of Mr Gilman at any time since 2002, other than to retrieve hard copy records from archives. 58 If there are, those documents may well have real utility to the applicants which would outweigh the burden imposed on Quadrant of providing further discovery. 25 His evidence dealt with Westpac's email system and its document servers.
