The application was filed by the applicant on 24 October 2006. Lever v Comcare [2007] FCA 99 (8 February 2007) 5 Ms Dinnen who appeared for the respondent before me today, however, in opposing the application for extension of time, drew my attention to a judgment of Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344. 7 Those two cases proceed upon different lines of reasoning. 6 The criticism made of Mr Lever's process is that it fails to identify with precision the question of law which he seeks to agitate on the appeal.
