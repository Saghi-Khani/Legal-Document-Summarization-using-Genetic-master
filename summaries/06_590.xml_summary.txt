An amended draft order nisi was filed, in which prohibition was sought against the Minister, and certiorari and mandamus against the Tribunal, although the Tribunal was still not named as a respondent to the proceeding. There is no evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that any of those involved, including "ring leaders", were dealt with by authorities in a persecutory manner; rather, of those arrested, all were convicted and fined for scorning religion. The applicant's claim is one that has merits. There was jurisdictional error. The applicant applied to this Court for review of that decision of the Tribunal.
