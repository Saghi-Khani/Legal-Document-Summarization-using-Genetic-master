By amended application the appellant relied upon two grounds of appeal: first, that the Tribunal failed to carry out its statutory duty by breaching s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'); and second, that the Tribunal did not believe the appellant was a Falun Gong practitioner due to bias. SZHPY v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 155 (14 February 2007) I agree with the conclusion and reasoning of the Federal Magistrate. His Honour found the Tribunal's decision was based upon adverse credibility findings which arose from an assessment of the appellant's oral evidence.
