On 5 December 2005, the Tribunal sent Mr Bunnag an invitation under s 359(2) of the Act to provide further information relating to a variety of matters including details of the sponsor's medical condition, details of her hospitalisation and the nature and extent of any support provided by him to her. That consideration was said to be the mental health of the sponsor at the date of the Tribunal decision. No jurisdictional error is made out. Mr Chu, who was assisting Mr Bunnag, suggested to the Tribunal that it may be able to make the health inquiries direct.
