By motion filed on 14 November 2008 the first and second respondents to the appeal ("Sunstate Orchards" and Mr Strahley) seek an order that the appellants (formerly the three applicants in the principal proceeding) provide security for the first and second respondents' costs of the appeal and an order for a stay of the appeal should any security so ordered not be provided within the time limited by any order. Mr Breed is the third respondent. Thus no loss arises. It is true that many of the grounds of appeal challenge findings of fact as against the weight of evidence.
