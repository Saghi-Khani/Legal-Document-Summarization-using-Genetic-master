For these reasons, bearing in mind the circumstances of this case outlined above (at [17]), I consider there is sufficient doubt as to whether the primary judge has made an error of principle in her assessment of the deceptive similarity of the trade marks under s 44 to justify granting leave to Channel to appeal this aspect of the primary judge's decision to the Full Court. Did the fourth affidavit contain material evidence? Then, both counsel appeared to submit differing alternative approaches. It was always the intention that The Food Channel Pty Ltd would use the trade mark.
