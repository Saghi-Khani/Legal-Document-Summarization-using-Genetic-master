1 On 18 April 2008 the plaintiff ("Nationwide") filed its originating process under s 459G(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for an order setting aside a statutory demand served on it by the defendant ("the Deputy Commissioner"). 13 Mr Johnson recognises that in order to obtain the relief that he seeks, it is necessary to offer certain undertakings to the Court. There is evidence before me which demonstrates sufficiently that the Deputy Commissioner accepts he has a responsibility to administer tax agent registration requirements. Those components consist of income tax liability in amounts totalling approximately $58,000.
