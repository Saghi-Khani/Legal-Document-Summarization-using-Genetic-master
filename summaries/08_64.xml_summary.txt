THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 411(1)  12 On 21 December 2007, I made orders pursuant to s 411(1) of the Act that Hostworks convene a meeting of its members for the purpose of considering the proposed scheme. Consequently, if the proposed scheme is supported at the proposed meeting of shareholders of Hostworks, at present, there does not appear to be any reason why the scheme then would not be approved. 5 Mr Shore is also an executive director of Macquarie Capital Group Limited. Upon exercise of the options, the option holders will receive consideration equivalent to the scheme consideration.
