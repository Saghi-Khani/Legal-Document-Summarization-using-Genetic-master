Claims 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 28 (and dependent claims 13, 14, 15 and 29) are not useful because the process claimed does not achieve a Sodium Alendronate Trihydrate with the specified characteristics relating to high yield and purity promised by the patent. Alphapharm Pty Ltd v Merck & Co Inc [2006] FCA 1227 (15 September 2006) Merck seeks orders limiting discovery in two ways. That would not seem to be a correct approach. First, Merck resists the discovery of documents relating to experimental work, testing or evaluation conducted after the date of grant.
