35 For those reasons, I find that there was no error in the Federal Magistrate's decision because in answering the Tribunal's question the appellant was thereby providing this information to the Tribunal pursuant to s 424A(3)(b). In those submissions he referred to SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 228 CLR 152. The Tribunal noted that the appellant had not claimed protection in any of those countries. They are citizens of Lithuania. His wife worked. For those reasons, the first ground of appeal must be rejected.
