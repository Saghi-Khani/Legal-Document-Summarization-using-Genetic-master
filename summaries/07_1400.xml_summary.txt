The Trustee seeks leave of the Court to distribute the sum of $56,617.50, received by him as trustee of Mr Hudson's property. Subsequently Wilson FM dismissed the remaining matters in Mr Hudson's application, those orders being made on 17 August 2007. The total amount proposed to be paid is less than the moneys held by the Trustee. There does not seem to be any dispute that the sum is owing to Mrs Hudson. Mr Pascoe presses to have the matter determined today. 4 The Trustee has established service of this application, effected on 10 November 2006.
