The second divisional application itself proceeded to grant on 11 December 2000, as the 679 patent. That is not, of course, to imply any fault on the part of the Patents Office in the matter of making up the register. The second request could not, therefore, be amended under s 105. What I have called the first error was referred to in a letter from the examiner to Mr Owens dated 22 June 1999. It was, it seems, substantially in response to this position taken by Screenex that the applicants filed their Notice of Motion.
