4 Section 477(2A) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) provides, relevantly, that except with the approval of the Court, a liquidator of a company must not compromise "a debt to the company" if the amount claimed by the company is more than, relevantly, $20,000. The second issue related to a "confidentiality order" sought by Mr Hamilton. Various submissions were made. 5 As recounted in earlier reasons for judgment, on 1 June 2006 Newpage paid $610,000 to CBI. Elderslie supports the compromise. The Court lacks power to grant "approval" except in those two cases.
