The personal services provided by Mr Dixon were used exclusively by the Company. Exclusive Use  35 The reasoning of the Tribunal on the question of whether the Company had exclusive use of the Garage is not entirely clear. It is common ground that the upper level was used exclusively by the Company in the 2002 income year. 18 The Commissioner's Statement of Facts and Contentions asserted that ' the Business Premises ' were not physically separate from the premises that Mr Dixon used for private purposes. The ground floor of the two storey building is used as a garage.
