Associate:  Dated: 21 July 2009  Counsel for the Appellant: F Kunc SC with C Spruce   Solicitor for the Appellant: Robinson Legal   Counsel for the Respondents: D.F.C. MOORE J:  This judgment concerns the question of whether the orders of a Full Court ( Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCAFC 71) and related orders should be stayed pending an application by the appellant, Mr Hogan, for special leave to appeal against the judgment of the Full Court. My reasons may be briefly stated. At least I cannot conclude that there are not insubstantial prospects of the grant of special leave.
