As Deane J observed, the explanation required will depend on the circumstances of the case. This is because on 17 July 2009, after the time to seek review of the District Registrar's decision had expired, Mr Hawkins made a further application to set aside the bankruptcy notice or to extend time for compliance with it. Conclusion For the reasons given above I am not satisfied that the Court's discretion to extend the time allowed under r 2.03 of the Bankruptcy Rules should be exercised in the applicant's favour. Delay In this case the delay was extensive.
