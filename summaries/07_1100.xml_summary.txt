The appellant claimed that if he were to return to the Ukraine he would be imprisoned. On that date the Tribunal affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa to the appellant. 7 On 23 August 2005 the Tribunal received additional information from Mr Slater as requested in the first s 424A(1) letter and the second s 424A(1) letter. This ground of appeal is accordingly dismissed. 19 The appellant also submitted that the second Tribunal made its decision based upon documents provided to the first Tribunal hearing.
