It states a fact that the applicants have not been provided with the terms of the policy. The first that I propose to deal with is the notice of motion brought by the applicants filed on 29 May which seeks four orders. The effecting of the insurance is pleaded without any specificity, other than that the first respondent on behalf of the applicants effected insurance with the second to fifth respondents. Paragraph 9, pleads that the applicants paid a premium. The existing statement of claim is worse. The second to fifth respondents are well-known underwriters.
