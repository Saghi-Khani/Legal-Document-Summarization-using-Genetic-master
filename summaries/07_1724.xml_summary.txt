6 The question of the appellant's accident and his request that the Tribunal adjourn the hearing was first raised orally before Federal Magistrate Barnes. The second is that the Tribunal failed to give the appellant a chance to provide information and evidence. I can find no error in relation to any of those matters. 3 The appeal is an appeal from the decision of Federal Magistrate Barnes delivered on 11 July 2007 which dismissed an amended application for Judicial Review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 10 August 2006 and handed down on 19 September 2006.
