Against the background of the history of the failure to formulate a coherent pleading, the Court made the orders striking out the Further Amended Statement of Claim and imposing a discipline upon the applicants' legal adviser to file any notice of motion for leave to re-plead by 11 May 2009. The first applicant is Mr Terry Van Der Velde and Mr David Stimpson. The first respondent adopts the submissions of the third respondent. Secondly, the fundament of the claim sought to be advanced in the proceeding is this. The matter was listed before me on 16 February 2009.
