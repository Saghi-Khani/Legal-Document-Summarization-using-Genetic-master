Brookfield v Yevad Products Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1180 (31 August 2006) The applicants seek an order for inspection of a document discovered only in a List of Documents filed on 20 July 2006, in which it is described as 'Draft Report prepared by Barry Pinder of Pump Technology Pty Ltd dated 7 August 1995' (the report). I do not think that Lindgren J's principle (3) in Southcorp should be read as suggesting that a draft report provided by an expert to solicitors for the purpose of litigation is not itself privileged.
