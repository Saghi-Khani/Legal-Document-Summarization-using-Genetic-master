that from at least 19 June 2007 to January 2009, ADC represented that certain artworks promoted for sale on the Website were painted by a person of Aboriginal descent and/or Ubanoo Brown. The items painted by Mr Goodridge were advertised and sold by Mr Antoniou and/or ADC through various means. Many would be on consignment. The ACCC alleges that ADC and Mr Antoniou have breached s 53(eb) of the TP Act by making the website representations as to country of origin on the Website and on eBay when making the carved wooden bird representations.
