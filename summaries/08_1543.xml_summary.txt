41 On Monday 17 October 2005 Mr Smits and Mr Bryce were at the site awaiting the outcome of the meeting of employees at 6.30 am. As noted, he had actual authority to "act for the persons on the job" and to call meetings of AWU members to discuss union affairs (rule 45(4)). Mr O'Connor was the delegate of the AWU and Mr Wakelin the delegate of the CFMEU. Mr O'Connor voted to go on strike. Mr Goring also said nothing to John Holland to this effect.
