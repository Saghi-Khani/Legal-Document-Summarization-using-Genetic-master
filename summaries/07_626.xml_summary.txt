9 As already indicated, on 1 December 2006 the Minister made a decision to cancel the applicant's absorbed person visa. 26 The only issue to be considered in relation to this ground is whether the applicant had "ceased to be an immigrant", within the meaning of that expression in s 34(2)(b) of the Act , before 2 April 1984. It was also noted that the Tribunal had failed to describe the best interests of the children as a "primary consideration". On 16 August 2006 Victoria Legal Aid provided a detailed submission on the applicant's behalf.
