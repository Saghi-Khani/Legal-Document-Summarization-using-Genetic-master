On 1 December 2007 two members of the action group, the applicant said, were arrested by the Public Security Bureau. That then means the Tribunal must comply with s 424A. Section 424A(2A) is engaged "if the Tribunal gives clear particulars of the information to the applicant, and invites the applicant to comment on or respond to the information, under s 424AA". However, the Federal Magistrate also concluded that the information in question was independent country information which the Tribunal had no obligation to notify to the applicant. That contention must be rejected for the reasons already given.
