This was in circumstances in which Mr and Mrs Matthews were said to have been fully aware of the Substituted Product Scheme. She says that neither Mr Jones nor any other person informed her of any of the matters mentioned in [52] of the amended statement of claim in or about the first half of 1999 as alleged or at all. No affidavit in reply was filed by Fortron. There may yet, by amendment, be a reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting or defending that proceeding.
