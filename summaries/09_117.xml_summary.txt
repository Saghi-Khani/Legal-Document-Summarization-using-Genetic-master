The third respondent is an adjudicator who was appointed under the BCIP Act to deal with the claim made by Flea's Concreting against Blue Chip Development for progress payments. "  The proceedings in this Court were commenced by application and statement of claim each filed on 30 January 2009. That application was dealt with by the duty judge, Bennett J, on 3 February 2009. In the first instance, Blue Chip Development sought an ex parte interlocutory injunction from this Court. The matter came before me today upon a different footing. Accordingly the notice of motion will be dismissed with costs.
