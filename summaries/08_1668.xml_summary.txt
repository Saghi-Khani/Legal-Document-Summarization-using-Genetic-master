21 Cadbury's third challenge is limited only to the "dominant purpose" element of the privilege claim. However, the overall question before Heerey J was whether the 216 documents, including the Hodgson Interview transcript, were protected from disclosure by litigation privilege. His Honour found that litigation was reasonably anticipated as at 15 December 2004 - that is, prior to the Hodgson interview on 17 December 2004: Visy No 2 at [78]-[93]. I do not accept that submission. The contents of the stare decisis principle are not in dispute: e.g. indemnity) basis rather than on the usual party-party basis.
