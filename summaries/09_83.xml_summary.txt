The primary judge held that the information about the Communist Party of India and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) fell within s 424A(3). In SZMAE v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1701 at [23] Edmonds J observed that:  [23] In any event, the Minister submitted that no jurisdictional error arises. The appellant appealed to the Federal Magistrates Court, filing an amended application on 25 July 2008. Section 424AA itself imposes no obligation upon the Tribunal. I agree with these submissions. On 29 June 2007 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.
