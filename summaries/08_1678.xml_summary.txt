Second registration test  15 Because the Bindurnna application was made after 30 September 1998 and before 15 April 2007 and was not on the Register of Native Title Claims when the Native Title Amendment Act 2007 (Cth) commenced, the Registrar was required to reconsider the application for registration. 12 The conditions of the registration test are set out in section 190B and 190C of the NTA. 6 Pursuant to s 190F(6) of the NTA, the Court may consider any 'other reason' why an application should not be dismissed. THE APPLICATION  9 The applicants represent the Bindurrna people.
