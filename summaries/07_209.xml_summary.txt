The show cause application asserts a breach of the rules of natural justice. After his release the appellant claims that his new employer was requested to "watch the appellant" to see if he continued to practise Falun Gong. 12 The applicant's grounds contained in his notice of appeal do not identify any error in the Federal Magistrate's decision. On 8 June 2006 a differently constituted Tribunal held its hearing which the applicant attended and gave oral evidence. This ground is unparticularised. It is without substance. My reasons, which follow, essentially reflect the submissions put by the first respondent.
