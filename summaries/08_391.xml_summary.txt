Jarra Creek Central Packing Shed Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 391 (27 March 2008) 6 In relation to the other documents which are not the subject of submissions by the ACCC, there are two questions for decision: • whether previous orders for discovery made in this proceeding have the effect of overriding the implied undertaking attaching to the documents so that the documents in question must be discovered by the Visy parties; and • whether the Court should grant leave to disclose the documents notwithstanding any implied undertaking. Clearly such an exercise may be both expensive and time consuming.
