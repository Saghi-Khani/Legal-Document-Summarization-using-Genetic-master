At the hearing before me, both parties made submissions concerning the effect of the orders of the Federal Magistrates Court. The respondents primarily seek to have the proceedings dismissed or the pleadings struck out. That application invokes the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1989 (ACT) ("ADJR Act (ACT)") although other legislation is also referred to, including the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT). The issue is whether the applicant can continue any part of the proceedings in his own name pursuant to s 60(4). The applicant filed the relevant documents in August 2006. Numerous causes of action are potentially raised.
