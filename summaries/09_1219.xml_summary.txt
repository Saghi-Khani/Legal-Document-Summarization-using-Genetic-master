The question before the Court is whether the hearing of the appeal, currently listed before Reeves J, should be adjourned as sought by Ms Kerr. Kerr v American Express Australia Limited [2009] FCA 1219 (28 October 2009) Before me is a notice of motion filed by Ms Kerr, who is the appellant in a substantive appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court to this Court. In Court this morning Ms Kerr did not appear. In the circumstances I was prepared to grant leave to Mr Kerr to represent Ms Kerr for the purposes of today's proceedings.
