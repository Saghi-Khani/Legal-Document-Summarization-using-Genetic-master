The applicant also alleges under the heading "The Magistrate creating a confusion in the case/and his bias attitude", that the Magistrate reserved the costs for the appearances relating to discovery in January and February 2009 against him even though the appearances "were the respondent fault". On that date his Honour made orders in relation to the filing of the affidavits in the Highline matter. Leave to appeal is required under the Federal Court of Australia Rules. For these reasons I would dismiss the application. The applicant filed an affidavit, sworn 23 July 2009, in support of his application.
