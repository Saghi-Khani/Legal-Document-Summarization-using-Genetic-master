Within the three-month period, the plaintiff filed an application which included the claim for an order under s 509(6) that ASIC deregister the company on 15 December 2010. Moreover, as Judge Burley said, the other circumstances in which the discretion to defer dissolution may be exercised arise where the interested party needs to make an application in relation to the administration of the liquidation. 11 Here, the plaintiff seeks an extension for two years. In that case, the proper purpose was the maintenance of proceedings in the District Court against the company by the plaintiffs.
