Dr Jureidini is sufficiently concerned to say that his mental condition is likely to deteriorate to such an extent that he would not permit him to travel, notwithstanding the conditions upon which the proposed removal is to take place. 7 That circumstance gives rise to some difficult questions of interpretation of s 198 of the Act. 12 I therefore propose to make an order restraining the second respondent from removing the applicant from Australia until further order. That is a matter for another day. Beyazkilinc v Manager Baxter Immigration Reception & Processing Centre [2006] FCA 16 (18 January 2006)
