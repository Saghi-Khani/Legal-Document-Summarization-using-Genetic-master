Section 43 of the Federal Court Act vests in the court or a judge "jurisdiction to award costs in all proceedings before the Court". On 18 September 2009, I made the following orders in these proceedings: The appeal is allowed. The proceeding before the Court in the present case was an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court by way of rehearing. In consequence of that application, I made the following directions: The appellants file and serve any submissions they wish to make concerning the costs of the proceeding before the Refugee Review Tribunal on the third occasion, within 14 days.
