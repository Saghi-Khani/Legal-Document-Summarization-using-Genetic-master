His evidence in cross-examination was that the trade-in price Mr Kumnick offered on the evening of 20 March 1998 was what made the truck "very interesting" to him. Vibration problems, in the context of this case, included 'rough ride'. Dr Morrison noted that neither Dr McLean nor Mr Lambert made any objective quantification and assessment of the defects alleged by Mr Lowe and compared these assessments against 'criteria of acceptability'. Mack job cards recorded the complaint. The applicants also alleged other defects in the truck. See FORS Report, p 1. This was, so Mr Lowe conceded, "above average".
