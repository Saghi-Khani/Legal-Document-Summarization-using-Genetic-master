Paragraph 5 requires Mr Donovan to give the notice mentioned in the order. The Second to Fifth Respondents, Gemhall Holdings Pty Limited and Time 2000 Pty Limited and the Applicants may agree in writing that orders 10 (a), (b) or (c) are to be varied. This is an application for leave to appeal from orders made by Besanko J on 19 December 2008, which orders were made pursuant to O 25A of the Federal Court Rules (the Rules). I do not think that would give rise to any substantial injustice on those parties' part.
