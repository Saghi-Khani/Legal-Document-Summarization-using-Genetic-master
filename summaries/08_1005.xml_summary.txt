No Australian decision has apparently addressed the question now posed by the competing submissions of Lion Nathan and Gallo Winery . 5 Section 101(2) is silent as to the date from which an order may be made; the sub-section simply provides that " the court may order the Registrar to remove the trade mark from the Register ". The Amended Application be dismissed. This decision also provides some support for the conclusion reached. Specific provision is made in the Trade Marks Act 1938 where an event or decision is to have retrospective effect (see: e.g. section 46(6)).
