The Federal Magistrate considered that the appellant's evidence disclosed the appellant's attempts to distance himself from his capacity to speak Mandarin (at [119]-[123]). Grounds 5 to 10 relate to the Federal Magistrate's dismissal of the appellant's claims of a denial of a fair hearing before the Tribunal by reason of inadequate interpretation. There has never been any judicial decision determining the judicial review application. In this further application the appellant claimed for the first time jurisdictional error by reason of inadequate interpretation before the Tribunal. Unlike Ms Qian, Ms Xie can understand Fuqing.
