The High Court made clear that, even in circumstances where the tribunal acts blamelessly, it may nevertheless fall into jurisdictional error if its decision is affected by the fraud of a third party such as an applicant's migration agent. A "response to hearing" invitation form was attached to the letter. In this case the appellant says the agent's dishonesty denied the appellant the opportunity to appear at the hearing. Accordingly the Magistrate allowed the matter to proceed to a hearing. He says, however, that his signature has been forged. Neither the appellant nor his migration agent attended.
