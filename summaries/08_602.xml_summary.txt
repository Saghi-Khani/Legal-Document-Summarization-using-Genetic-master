That notice of appeal says that the appeal is from the whole of the judgment given on 17 December 2007. On that date his Honour made an order affirming a sequestration order made against Mr Etl by a Registrar on 25 September 2007. 7 In these circumstances the first issue for the Court is whether leave should be granted to Mr Etl to make an application for leave to appeal against his Honour's refusal of the adjournment out of time. Etl v Kliger Partners [2008] FCA 602 (30 April 2008) I will hear the parties on costs.
