That statement, which became Exhibit AA1 on the voir dire, was prepared by the relevant inspector using, so it was said, the records of Mr Suter's two interviews on 11 March and 22 March 2004 to do so. The occasion for such an application would not arise until a witness was being questioned as though the party who called him was, with the leave of the Court, cross-examining him under s 38(1) of the Evidence Act . 20 May 2004, the inspector met with Mr Suter again. Amendments had been made in red, blue and black ink.
