Mr Rana has no reasonable or available ground for impugning the Trustee's decision under the AD(JR) Act or s 178 of the Bankruptcy Act. If such be the case, the issue which arises is not, as in Daemar , with the question whether Mr Rana's show cause proceedings is an "action". They clearly are not relevantly damages for a "personal injury or wrong done to [him]": cf s 60(4) and s 116(2)(g). An application was made to the High Court for special leave.
