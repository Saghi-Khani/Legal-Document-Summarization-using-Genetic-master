It would be a matter for primary assessment by Comcare in the event of the applicant succeeding on this appeal. He said in his report that  it is only with the fullness of time she has become totally and permanently impaired. In that case the employee had suffered a compensable injury to his back before 1 December 1988 which resulted in impairment, but not a permanent impairment. A question of law? I accept the approach of Dr Sale which accords with my own views. 3 An impairment is permanent if it is likely to continue indefinitely: 1988 Act, s 4.
