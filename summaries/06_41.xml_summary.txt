GROUND SIX: MR ROSS' ADMISSION BY CONDUCT  44 On the third day after the appellants took over the business, Mrs Hinds complained to Mr Featherston that she could not understand how the takings, as represented by the first respondents, could be sustained on the customer activity which the appellants were experiencing. The business operated a separate trading account. Ground three asserts that his Honour either failed to find whether the appellants understood the correct position concerning the turnover after the Meeting or to give adequate reasons for any implicit finding to that effect. The reasons include reference to relevant evidence.
