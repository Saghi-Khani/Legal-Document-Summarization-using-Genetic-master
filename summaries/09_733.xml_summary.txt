The applicant and the Minister agreed that, by reason of s 499 of the Migration Act and the terms of Direction 21, the Tribunal was required to consider "the protection of the Australian community, and members of the community" (paragraph 2.3(a) of Direction 21). In the present case the Tribunal identified the issue of general deterrence as relevant. The Minister cancelled the applicant's visa on 24 December 2008. The decision under review is affirmed. For example, general deterrence involves consideration of the consequences for "similar conduct".
