14 Allsop J in SZEZI v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 at 21 gave an analysis of the 'information' in which s 424A(1) operates. It is not the information in the originating application for a visa, namely, the claim that the appellant had been detained for 12 days, that was the reason or part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision. 7 The Court also found that the Tribunal did not have any concern about inconsistency between the Protection Visa application and the claims at the hearing.
