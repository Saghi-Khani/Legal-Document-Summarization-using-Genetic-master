Ground 2   Language ability  32 Whether an applicant before the Tribunal has "functional English" or "better than functional English" is a question of fact for the Tribunal. â€¢ The Tribunal considered the information given by the appellant in relation to property valuations and decided not to place any weight on it. The Tribunal denied the appellant the opportunity to comment or provide further evidence and documentation in relation to the real estate valuations. The appellant appealed the Tribunal's decision to the Federal Magistrates Court. Accordingly, the appellant's first ground of appeal fails.
