In relation to costs incurred by Mr Rhys Thomas however I do not consider an award of costs on an indemnity basis is warranted. Further, I consider that there is a sound basis for an order awarding Mr Troy Thomas his costs incurred in these proceedings on an indemnity basis. The judgment constituted the Court's orders and reasoning in respect of these discrete claims. Should costs be reserved? Following agreement of the parties, the Court had ordered that the claims of the applicant in Pt A para 7 of the application be heard and determined separately.
