It is not tenable to suggest that any mere association Ms Luck has raised provides any possible ground for a reasonable apprehension of bias by the fair-minded and informed lay observer: Bienstein 195 ALR at 232 [33]. An unsuccessful litigant may make all sorts of assertions against the judge or court in which he, she or it lost their case. The Australian Government Solicitor acts for a respondent in other proceedings before the primary judge whose decision Ms Luck has also sought to challenge in other proceedings before a differently constituted Full Court. That would be intolerable.
