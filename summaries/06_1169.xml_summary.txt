13 During the execution of the warrant Mr Dimock made a claim for legal professional privilege in respect of the Dimocks documents. The AFP may have had good reasons to suspect the documents seized in the second Rosebery search were the same documents which had been seized in the Dimocks search, and in respect of which a claim for legal professional privilege had already been made. They are documents relating to legal advice provided by Dimocks to the applicant. The applicant also submits that at the time of the Concord search, she was not involved in any litigation.
