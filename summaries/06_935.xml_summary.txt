Unfortunately Mr Richardson, who was to represent both their interests, was unable to attend a meeting of creditors held on 24 March 2006 to consider the variation and the alternative of winding up the company. A Deed of Company Arrangement (the Deed) was adopted by a meeting of creditors in February 2005. 3 Forrest Nursery and Mr Richardson now apply to the Court for orders terminating the winding up, setting aside the termination of the Deed and ordering the variation of the Deed in accordance with their original proposal. That was Landshore Pty Ltd (Landshore) trading as Timbertech Planting Services.
