In substance, Mr Stoyef's pleaded case is that, for reasons that will appear, Masu, as a "regulated person", was obliged to give him and the group members a PDS that Westpoint or the relevant Westpoint entity, as the "responsible person", was obliged to prepare. It includes within the expression "financial product", relevantly, an interest in a managed investment scheme that is not a registered scheme (para (ba) of s 764A(1)). Subsection (1) of s 1013C provides that a PDS must include, relevantly, statements and information required by s 1013D and the information required by s 1013E.
