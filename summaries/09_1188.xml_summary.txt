In relation to the Karuna group extortion incident, it was contended in substance that the Federal Magistrate fell into error in not finding that the Tribunal had not addressed the appellant's claim to be a refugee on the basis that he had been persecuted because he was a member of a particular social group namely Muslim businessmen in Sri Lanka and that the Tribunal had erred in finding that the extortion was directed at the appellant because of his personal wealth, in respect of which finding there was no evidence. He then left for Negombo ("the protest incident").
