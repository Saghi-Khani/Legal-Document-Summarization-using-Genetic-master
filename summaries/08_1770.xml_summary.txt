The Suzlon companies relied on evidence that Mr Bangad had executed letters of indemnity as general manager of Headway Shipping in April 2008, while he was working as an employee of one of the Suzlon companies. Secondly, the Suzlon companies allege that they received no benefit from the guarantee of the time charter which Suzlon Infrastructure purportedly gave of Headway Shipping's performance. I had no regard to them for the purposes of forming my view that an order under O 8 r 2 should be made for service of the Suzlon parties' cross-claim on Mr Bangad in India.
