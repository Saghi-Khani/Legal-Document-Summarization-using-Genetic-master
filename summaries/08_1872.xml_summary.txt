1 I have before me an Application to set aside a Bankruptcy Notice. 20 The claims made by Pinata Pty Limited in the Supreme Court proceedings, in its capacity as plaintiff, were also ultimately dismissed when Pinata Pty Limited failed to put up security for costs as contemplated by par 1 of the Orders made by Young CJ in Eq on 16 August 2007. When that material was tendered I deferred ruling upon its admissibility. The Application was filed on 11 September 2008. 24 In 1996, the respondent to the current Application was appointed joint receiver of the Partnership.
