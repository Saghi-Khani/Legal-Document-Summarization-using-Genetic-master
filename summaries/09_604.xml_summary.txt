I only propose to order, at this stage, security in relation to costs concerning the preparation of the matter for trial. Mr Forbes' evidence is that as of 18 March 2009, the first respondent has incurred $85,119.25 in costs and disbursements. The promissory note was assigned by Monibrook to the first applicant. It has not discharged the burden. The first respondent also denies that it is liable in negligence. The second applicant is seeking damages against the first respondent. We do not accept responsibility to any other person for the contents of the special purpose financial report.
