They also say that in or about March 2002 Reynolds Lawyers went further and positively advised them that a further Deed of Release, which had been amended by the bank, covered only their claims in respect of the balanced trust investment, and not their claims in respect of the Bond. 4 The Smolles returned to Australia in early 2001. HIS HONOUR: It is. MR WILLIAMS: Yes. I made a self-executing order which required the Smolles to file and serve a notice of change of solicitor by no later than 3 June 2007, failing which their application would be dismissed.
