It was misleading to identify in the Summer of Love catalogue a "was" price which did not represent the price at which an item had been offered for sale and would have been purchased by the hypothetical consumer immediately before the sale commenced. 23 Contrary to the Usual Price Representations in the Summer of Love catalogue the Was price in that catalogue for each of the 17 items listed in paragraph 12 was not the usual price for that item of jewellery for the period from 1 December 2005 to 28 January 2006. Prouds referred to several authorities. This occurred.
