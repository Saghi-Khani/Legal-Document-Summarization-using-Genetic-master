Having ascertained from the Tribunal that it would resume the hearing on 11 March 2008, the applicants caused a summons to Mr Brereton to be issued on 12 February 2008. Neither have the applicants led any evidence on the subject in the present proceeding. This, in turn depends on whether the expenditure of $14,968,000 shown in the partnership returns was an allowable deduction under s 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (the 1997 Act). Mr de Simone replied as follows:  Mr Brereton is overseas. The applicants' case in this respect should be accepted.
