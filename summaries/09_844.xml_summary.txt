The Minister submitted that the power given to the Minister pursuant to s 47 was not constrained by any obligation to accord natural justice or procedural fairness to the tenants whose rights would be affected, indeed extinguished, by the giving of a notice pursuant to s 47. Fifteen Housing Associations control the Alice Springs town camps. The persons present at the meeting included Council representatives, Housing Association representatives and interested town camp residents.
