I refused to adjourn the appeal and gave the appellants an opportunity to make submissions in support of the appeal. On 27 May 2009 the appellants appeared by telephone. The evidence does not disclose any request by the first appellant to the Tribunal for an extension of time either during the hearing before the Tribunal or thereafter. The illness of his wife made the first appellant feel extremely stressed. I accept the Minister's submissions. First, the appellants submitted that during the hearings before the Tribunal and Federal Magistrates Court the second appellant was unwell and did not attend.
