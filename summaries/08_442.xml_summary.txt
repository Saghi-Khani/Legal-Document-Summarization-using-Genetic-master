5 At the time of the decision of the High Court in HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd (2004) 217 CLR 640 it was well established that, in the case of the purchase of property induced by misleading statements, the correct measure of damages (apart from consequential losses) was obtained by deducting the true value of the property at the date of the purchase from the purchase price. 17 Roberts adopted the rate of 15%. The first applicant retained the motel and there is no evidence of unprofitable trading at any time. I do not agree.
