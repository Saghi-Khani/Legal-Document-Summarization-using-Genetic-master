CONCLUSION  19 The appellant has failed to demonstrate that the Federal Magistrate ought to have concluded that s 424A had application to the information before the Tribunal on which it made the finding that Mr Haque had been available to give the appellant advice throughout the period between May 2005 and the date of the Tribunal hearing. The appellant did not adduce evidence in either Court to explain the above forensic decisions. 20 The appeal will be dismissed. DID THE APPELLANT PROVE THAT S 424A APPLIED TO THE INFORMATION? That file includes the appellant's protection visa application.
