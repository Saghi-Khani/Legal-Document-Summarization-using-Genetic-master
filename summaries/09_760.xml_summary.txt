The ACC's application to re-open, made during the hearing, was withdrawn in the face of SS's objection and my indication that an explanation for the late production would be required. The ACC submitted that the costs of this video-link should be costs in the cause and thus part of the general costs order in its favour in order 2. In these circumstances SS's claim for indemnity costs in respect of its notice of motion filed on 25 May 2009 is unfounded. Moreover, it was obliged to seek to tender the document in that form.
