THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS  9 Counsel for Mr Claveria argued that Pilkington had terminated Mr Claveria's employment in contravention of s 659(2)(e) of the Act, because Pilkington included in its reasons for termination the fact that: (1) Mr Claveria had recourse to competent administrative authorities; and (2) that he had filed a complaint against his employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations. Both Mr Dunstan and Mr Findlay gave evidence that Mr Seneviratne was a person to be trusted. 44 Mr Claveria went to work in the afternoon of 24 January 2007.
