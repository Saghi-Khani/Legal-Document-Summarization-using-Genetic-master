Johnson Winter & Slattery in the matter of Firepower Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [2008] FCA 1228 (13 August 2008) 12 Mr J T Johnson, counsel for Mr Boylan, submits that there is no evidence that Mr Hughes will not act impartially in deciding the question whether Rolen is a creditor of the defendant. Mr Graham is not willing, however, to fund Mr Kijurina if he should be appointed liquidator. 3 The defendant is in voluntary administration by reason of a resolution of its sole director, Timothy Johnson, passed on 21 July 2008.
