Indeed, it may prove that there is no substance at all in the allegations found in the evidence proposed to be led on behalf of Granitgard from Mr Gabriel. Termicide's submissions go so far as to raise a question as to whether or not Grantigard made a deliberate tactical decision not to call evidence in relation to penetrations and for that matter whether penetrations of the Termiglass barrier are in any way an issue in the proceedings. No such exceptional circumstances exist in the present case. On 10 June, Granitgard made application for the trial dates to be vacated.
