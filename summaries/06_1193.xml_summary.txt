The applications for leave to issue subpoenas to ASIC appear to rest on two bases set out in Mr Carey's affidavit of 15 August 2006. This, he believed, referred to the accruals between member companies of the Westpoint Group as described above. One of those bases raises a question about the nature of the debts relied upon to ground the statutory demands. ASIC has made an offer to identify relevant files with a view to providing to the respondents an opportunity to narrow the range of documents that they would seek under subpoena.
