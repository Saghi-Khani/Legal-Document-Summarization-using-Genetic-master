The visa applicant also claimed that his part-time English language, Chinese school and computer studies between 2000 and 2002 were equivalent to full time study which would satisfy the requirements of clause 101.213. The first respondent also argued that the transcript showed that neither the appellants' representatives nor the second appellant indicated at the hearing that they wanted a further opportunity to give oral evidence. Tribunal member: Okay. The Tribunal finds that the visa applicant did not enrol at ITM until two years after he completed year 12 in 2000. The appellants appeal from that decision. Thank you.
