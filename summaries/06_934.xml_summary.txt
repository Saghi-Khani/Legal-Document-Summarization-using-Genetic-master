In respect of the conduct of her supervisor, there is reference to evidence of bullying but it is said Ms Penhall-Jones was unable to link that evidence to indirect disability discrimination. 4 The State filed an application on 6 February 2006 seeking dismissal of the proceedings under r 13.10(a) of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules and this application was heard by his Honour on 20 February 2006. No adverse finding was made against the applicant in relation to whether she had a disability. This ground lacks substance. 28 Therefore I allow the appeal.
