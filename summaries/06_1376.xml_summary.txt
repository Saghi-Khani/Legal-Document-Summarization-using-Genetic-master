31 The first point to note is that no financial statements of Helimount since 30 June 2004 have been put in evidence. The liquidator states that the amount of the loans, not taking into account Helimount's ability to claim the debt from Mr Callipari, would make Helimount insolvent. The loan by Web Wealth to Helimount may involve an interest rate which is or was extortionate within s 588FD of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). It is common ground that the sum of $630,000 was paid by Web Wealth to Helimount and Mr Callipari. Helimount denies this allegation.
