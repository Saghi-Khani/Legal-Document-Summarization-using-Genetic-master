The information that the first named applicant has submitted does not provide the necessary detail for the Tribunal to be satisfied as to the veracity of his claims or that he has a well founded fear of persecution. There was no information that the Tribunal was obliged to give to the appellant by reason of s 424A(1).... 15 As in SZEZI v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1195 the applicant for the visa did not attend before the Tribunal, despite an invitation to do so. The same comment may be made in the present appeal.
