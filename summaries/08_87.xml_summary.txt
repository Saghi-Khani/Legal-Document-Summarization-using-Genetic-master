So something goes wrong with one out of every three units within the warranty period? Relevantly, the cross-respondent sought:  Complaint files and service repair records discovered by the cross-claimant and referred to at page 295 of the Judgment of O'Loughlin J in the proceedings between the cross-claimant and Newtronics in this Court. 7 At the hearing of this application, counsel for the cross-respondent, Mr Caine SC, stated that the cross-claimant's claim for damages was confined to the period December 1998 and April 2004. I expect that could happen, yes. Would that be right?
