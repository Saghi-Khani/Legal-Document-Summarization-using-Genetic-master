(4) The Tribunal, again, very particularly considered the evidence of the appellant concerning the circumstances under which he and his wife left the country, having been issued with passports by the Chinese authorities despite the appellant's claim to have previously been detained for three months for being a Falun Gong practitioner. The Tribunal is empowered but not obliged to seek out information. The matter before this Court concerns the second Tribunal decision. The Tribunal sent the appellant a s 424A letter to which the appellant responded. The Federal Magistrate found no jurisdictional error arose and dismissed the application.
