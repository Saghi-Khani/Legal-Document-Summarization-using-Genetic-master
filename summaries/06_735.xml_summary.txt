In my opinion, the Tribunal erred in law in its approach to the question whether she and Mr Kuhl were living in a marriage-like relationship during the period that she was in receipt of carer payments. Statutory framework 29 Part 2.5 of the Act deals with carer payments. (Grounds 4(b) and 4(c)). 55 The Tribunal referred specifically to the evidence as highlighting 'the marked contrast in the relationship between the applicant and Mr Kuhl at home and overseas'. Ms Pelka had been Mr Whittaker's carer since 2000. Ms Pelka paid the rates.
