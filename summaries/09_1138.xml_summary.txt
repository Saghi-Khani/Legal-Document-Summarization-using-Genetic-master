His Honour then referred to s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act and moved on to consider the applicant's Notice of Appeal. The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to file an Application for Leave to Appeal from a judgment of Emmett J, delivered on 26 August 2009 ( Budd v Secretary, Department of Housing, Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affair s [2009] FCA 961). In the Tribunal, the applicant sought a review of a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal given on 4 September 2008. It was not filed by that date.
