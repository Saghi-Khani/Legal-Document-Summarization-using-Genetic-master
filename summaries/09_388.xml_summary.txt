On 11 August, three days after Mr Gore refused to approve the faxed proposal, Mr Furman told Mr Boucher he had discovered that Mr Gore had retained GST credits of over $100,000. On 7 August 2008, Len Boucher of TWB prepared and faxed to me and Mark Saltzman a document titled ' Furman/Gore Joint Venture: Basis of negotiated distribution of bank Account' ... That document reflected the final distribution figures that I had agreed with Gore. Mr Boucher proposed $245,945. Mr Furman did not in that conversation claim that an agreement had been concluded on 7 August.
