Section 425 requires the Tribunal to invite the applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review, except in certain circumstances. The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed the appeal on 3 October 2008 concluding that the Tribunal's decision was not affected by any jurisdictional error. The appellant also claims the Tribunal and the Federal Magistrates Court reached conclusions that were implausible without giving the appellant an opportunity to be heard about those matters. He applied for a protection visa on 19 April 2007.
