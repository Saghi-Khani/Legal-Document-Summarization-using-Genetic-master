I am also satisfied that, in any event, the documents relating to the appeal do not disclose any jurisdictional error. The appellant sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. The Minister's delegate refused the application on 1 September 2005. I am satisfied that the appeal should be dismissed by reason of the appellant's failure to appear. The appellant again appealed to the Federal Magistrates Court and that Court dismissed the appellant's claim on 25 July 2008. The Tribunal affirmed the decision on 9 November 2005. The first ground must also be rejected.
