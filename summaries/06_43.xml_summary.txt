The form of the transaction was the sale and transfer of shares free from encumbrances. 20 After consideration of all of the matters referred to in s 177D(b) of the 36 Act, the Tribunal found that a reasonable person would conclude that the applicant, as trustee of the Trust, carried out the scheme with the sole purpose of obtaining the identified tax benefit. It also referred to the settling of Trust 2 on 12 June 1998 at a capital loss of $800 000. On its findings the Tribunal was correct to affirm the respondent's determination under s 177F.
