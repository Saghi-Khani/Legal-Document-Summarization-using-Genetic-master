In Vlasons Shipping Inc v Neuchatel Swiss General Insurance Co Limited [1998] VSC 135 , Byrne J applied the US prime borrowing rate in respect of a judgment in US dollars. Several issues arise in relation to costs. The last contentious matter is BHPB's application for a Bullock or Sanderson order so that Cosco will bear the costs of the successful respondent, Seawise. It is unlikely that they were paid in Australian currency. Some raise nice questions of principle. No reduction in interest is warranted by reason of any alleged delay on the part of BHPB in pursuing its claim.
