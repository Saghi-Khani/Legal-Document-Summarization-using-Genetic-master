Have any of Ms Reading's male colleagues been requested to perform junior staff duties? As has been outlined, on 31 December 2006 Dr Reading filed a complaint against WDP in the Commission alleging discrimination on the grounds of sex. 6 The first respondent by motion dated 11 June 2008 sought to strike out the application brought by Dr Reading pursuant to O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules (the Rules) or alternatively sought orders that Dr Reading be required to file a points of claim. First, a complaint must have been terminated. Please provide all relevant documentation.
