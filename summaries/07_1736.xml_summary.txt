The reason for rejecting the offer varied from employee to employee. 6 Many Skilled employees accepted the offer and commenced working with MES. The first relates to the notice given to the employees in January 2007 informing them that their employment with MES would cease on 1 March 2007. By cl 9.3 MES assumed liability for all employee entitlements including any entitlements for notice or redundancy on termination. The obligation to provide redundancy payments is to be found in the Skilled Engineering Ltd Mechanical Workshop Certified Agreement 2003-2006 and the Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award 1998.
