11 Where the respondent has under consideration the exercise of powers under s 206F of the Corporations Act , it is required to give the person concerned "a notice in the prescribed form". I consider that such an approach would be consistent with that taken by Fitzgerald J in Lucic and, because his Honour followed Lucic , by Wilcox J in Hunter . If the applicant does file an appeal within the time which I propose to allow, the grounds upon which he then relies will be a matter for him. It is that application which is presently before the court.
