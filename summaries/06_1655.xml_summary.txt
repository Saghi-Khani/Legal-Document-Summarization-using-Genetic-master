It was not a claim Mr Dunstan made at that point. Of course, that matter does not itself provide a reason to reject the claim if otherwise, by the female employee's conduct at work, Mr Dunstan's depression was materially contributed to by his employment, because the test is one of factual causation, not of fault. That is not a reason to defer the hearing and determination of this application. 39 The AAT considered whether Mr Dunstan might have been incapacitated for work because of depression from 2 January 1996.
