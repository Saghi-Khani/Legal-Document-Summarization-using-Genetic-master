An assessment as to credibility may in turn lead to adverse conclusions being made as to the genuineness of documents: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 at [34] per French J (as His Honour then was). An application was then filed with the Federal Magistrates Court on 25 September 2008. It was clearly open in such circumstances for the Tribunal to make the findings that it did. Both included photographs of a number of purported BNP officials including the Applicant. He was given an opportunity by the Tribunal to respond to those concerns.
