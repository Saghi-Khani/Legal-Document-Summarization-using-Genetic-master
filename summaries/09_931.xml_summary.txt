It is apparent from the definition of 'decision to which this Act applies' in s 3 of the ADJR Act that the Act only applies where there is a making of, proposal to make or requirement to make a decision, the decision is of an administrative character, and the decision is made under an enactment. These submissions are correct. The reasoning on determination of each proceeding is also similar. COMPLAINT  In this matter, the applicant seeks to review a decision of the respondent in raising an amended tax assessment and penalties for the July-September quarter of 2006.
