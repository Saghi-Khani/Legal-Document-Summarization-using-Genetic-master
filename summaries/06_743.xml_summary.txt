MWO's case is that it suffered loss only when Telstra sought to enforce the cap for which the 2003 agreement provided, notwithstanding that Telstra had represented to MWO that it would not do so. In paragraphs 34A to 34F of the statement of claim, MWO alleged promissory estoppel against Telstra. Facts relevant to the facts in issue emerge from the particulars and the evidence. Accordingly, the Court should apply the authorities to which I have just referred. These matters plainly bear on the question whether orders of the kind MWO proposed by its motion should be made.
