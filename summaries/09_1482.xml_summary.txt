In Combis, Trustee of the Property of Peter Jensen (Bankrupt) v Jensen (No 2) [2009] FCA 1383 I ordered that these proceedings be transferred to the Family Court of Australia. A notice of motion filed by Mrs Jensen for leave to amend the Defence and file and serve a Cross-Claim. If, for example, the trustee's claim is ultimately unsuccessful the trial judge may well consider that costs should follow the event, including in respect of interlocutory applications. Mrs Jensen was successful in her application for the proceedings to be transferred to the Family Court.
