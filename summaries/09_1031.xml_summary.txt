On 25 September 2000 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. Such letter, purportedly written by the National Amir of the Ahmadia Muslim Jamat, Dhaka was dated 2 September 2007 and addressed 'TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN'. FINDINGS  The Court will address the issue of whether the request of the Tribunal to the Australian Association made by its September 2007 was a request for 'additional information' as referred to in s 424(2) of the Act. Were the false letters 'information'? Section 424(2) refers to the Tribunal inviting the person to give additional information .
