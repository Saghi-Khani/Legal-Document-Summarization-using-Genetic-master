The latter document addressed the applicant's complaints concerning the Departmental submissions. The applicant submitted that he was not asking the Court to inquire whether the United States would in fact honour its undertaking not to seek or apply the death penalty: see McCrea v Minister for Justice and Customs [2005] FCAFC 180 ; (2005) 145 FCR 269. The applicant also made oral submissions on these issues. The Minister was wrong in determining the applicant would not be subjected to torture under s 22(3)(b) of the Act; 3.
