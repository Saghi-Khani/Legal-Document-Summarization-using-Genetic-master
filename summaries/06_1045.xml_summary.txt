Accordingly, jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal arises and Federal Magistrate Barnes erred , it is said, by failing to find that the Tribunal engaged in jurisdictional error when it exercised the discretion conferred by s 426A by proceeding to make a decision on the review rather than reschedule the applicant's appearance before it. No issue is raised concerning compliance with ss 425 or 425A as the appellant responded to the invitation on 27 September 2003 affirming a desire to appear.
