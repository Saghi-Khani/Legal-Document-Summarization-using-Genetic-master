In the reasons for disallowing the objection to the amended assessments, the Commissioner referred to Vincent's case. The applicants had not provided any evidence that their involvement in the ACM scheme was objectively different from the facts and circumstances ruled upon by the Federal Court in the case of Vincent [2002] FCAFC 291 ; 124 FCR 350. The scheme was a scheme within the meaning of Pt IVA that was entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of enabling a person to pay no tax or less tax. Section 226L therefore applied. Mr Hopkins claimed $23,888.
