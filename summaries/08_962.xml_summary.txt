6 However, in Best v Yellow Express Carriers Limited [2004] NSWSC 666 , Young CJ in Eq took a practical view to the question. The issue which arises is whether the former liquidators of the company remain as liquidators of the company upon reinstatement. 5 Mr Fernon SC, who appears this morning for the plaintiffs, has referred me to a line of authorities which reveals the dispute. However, there was then further communication with the previous liquidators which appeared to indicate a possible change of heart. I have in evidence before me a letter from ASIC dated 13 June 2008.
