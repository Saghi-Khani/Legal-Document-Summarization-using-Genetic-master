Banning the advertising of a comparison between the Optus $49 Cap Plan and the Telstra $40 Phone Plan would go far beyond what might be necessary in order to prevent any misleading or deceptive conduct. Thus, the modified advertisement does not represent that the Eveready Super Heavy Duty battery is the only direct competitor (within the Eveready range of batteries) of the Duracell alkaline batteries. Plainly, the monthly price of the two plans is specified to be different. The application for an interlocutory injunction be dismissed. This practical comparison must weigh powerfully against Telstra in the balance of convenience.
