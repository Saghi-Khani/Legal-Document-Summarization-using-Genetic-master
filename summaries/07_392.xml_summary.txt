That decision was followed by Young J in Applicant M47/2004 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 176. In those circumstances, it is unlikely that the Tribunal would have received information in the second appellant's hearing which would have impacted upon the first appellant's application for a review. 32 The Federal Magistrate found that because the appellants had not made out their claim of fear of persecution for a Convention reason, it was unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the issue of effective State protection. There was evidence to support that finding.
