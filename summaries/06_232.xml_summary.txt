I am aware of communications which indicate that, since early September 2005, in response to requests by the Department, the Australian High Commission in South Africa made enquiries of the South African authorities. 28 Counsel for the Respondent Minister concedes that the documents are relevant. 34 As to classes of documents, the authorities recognise a number which in the public interest should be immune from disclosure. On 26 February 2004, the Applicant filed an application for review of the Respondent's decision to issue the surrender warrant. I have personally studied the documents concerned. Ms Blackburn deposes to these matters.
