BACKGROUND  2 Mr Aalders, a chartered accountant who was a registered tax agent in New Zealand, applied to the Board for registration as a tax agent in Queensland on 2 August 2002. Mr Aalders was registered as a tax agent in Australia following the decision of the Tribunal, on a different basis to the application of the TTMR Act. This is not a matter where, notwithstanding the lack of practical outcomes of the appeal, the appeal would resolve an important issue of public law as was the case in Vanstone v Clark [2005] FCAFC 189.
