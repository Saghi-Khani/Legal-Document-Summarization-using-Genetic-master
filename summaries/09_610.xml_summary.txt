The Delegate decided not to accept the application for registration. Pursuant to s 190F(6) of the Act, the Court may consider any 'other reason' why an application should not be dismissed. The application was further amended by order of the Court in terms of an amended application filed on 19 October 1999. The applicants are represented by Central Desert Native Title Services. The Registrar advised the applicants on 19 July 2007 that the registration test had to be applied again. I note that there is nothing to prevent the applicants from filing a properly constituted claim in the future.
