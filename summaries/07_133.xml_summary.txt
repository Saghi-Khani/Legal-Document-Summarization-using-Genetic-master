9 The Federal Magistrate, in considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, found there was no breach of s 424A of the Act. With that letter he provided the July 1996 statement which, as I have said, was in the form of the statutory declaration but unsworn. Therefore, the Tribunal might be thought to be biased. The appeal should be dismissed. On that hearing, the appellant relied on four grounds. His Honour found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application. 28 In his written submissions the appellant raised seven grounds.
