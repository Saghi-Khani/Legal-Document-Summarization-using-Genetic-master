Any attempt to deal with the alleged failure to make a decision to review the second decision would, for the same reason, serve no useful purpose. Ms Luck has not sought, on notice, an order enlarging time in respect of the decisions and conduct to which the objections to competency relate. Ms Luck did not file any submissions prior to 26 September 2008. When an application for an extension of time to commence a proceeding under the ADJR Act is made the Court has an unfettered discretion. The notice of objection to competency was filed on 3 July 2008.
