(3) The Board may determine, in writing, that an investigation into matters relating to federally relevant criminal activity is a special investigation. By a summons dated 14 January 2009 issued under s 28(1) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) (the ACC Act) the second respondent, an examiner of the Australian Crime Commission (the ACC), required a person (later given the pseudonym "SS") to attend before an examiner at an examination for the purposes of a special operation pursuant to a determination of the ACC's Board. Section 7C(2) simply does not impose that obligation.
