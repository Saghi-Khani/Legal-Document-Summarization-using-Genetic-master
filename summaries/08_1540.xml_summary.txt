The Court also finds that the respondent would not suffer undue prejudice if the Court were to grant leave to Ms Budd to file and serve a notice of appeal out of time. The Tribunal delivered its decision on 21 February 2008 affirming the SSAT decision and dismissing Ms Budd's application: see Budd v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] AATA 137. 9 Ms Budd undertakes her work from home. That is the extent of her travelling. However, the existence of these two facts in isolation does not satisfy the travel test in s 1035(2).
