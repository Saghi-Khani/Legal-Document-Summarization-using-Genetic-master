3 On 30 May 2006 Mr Christodoulou filed a notice of motion (the first motion) seeking orders that he "be permitted to discontinue" the appeal and that the $10,000 be returned to him. Christodoulou v Disney Enterprises Inc [2006] FCA 902 (14 July 2006) If it did, his Honour did not think that s 25 would permit the Full Court jurisdiction to be exercised by a single judge. 2 Mr Christodoulou appealed. 19 I will therefore order that the two motions be referred for hearing by a Full Court. It is not a matter within the original jurisdiction.
