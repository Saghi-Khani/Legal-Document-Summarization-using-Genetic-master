In the end, I think that the risk of harm to the national interest does outweigh the needs of AWB in the present proceedings and I propose to order that access not be granted to any person to the 15 reports which have been produced pursuant to the orders which I made on 17 September 2009. I will not repeat what I said in AWB No 2 [2009] FCA 1047 concerning that matter. Although the masking, on its own, may not prevent the tender of at least some of the documents, it would probably do so in some cases.
