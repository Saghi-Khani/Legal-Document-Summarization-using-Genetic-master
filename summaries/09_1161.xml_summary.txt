I am thus satisfied that the State (via Mr Marzic) sought legal advice from the Parliamentary Counsel's Office on the second page of document 24 in Exhibit CM1. The fact that those questions include a disclosure of legal advice to another entity, Racing NSW, does not affect their status as questions for the required dominant purpose as a communication between the State (as the client) and Parliamentary Counsel (as the lawyer). Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales (No 8) [2009] FCA 1161 (12 October 2009) The respondents, however, had made no claim for privilege over that document.
