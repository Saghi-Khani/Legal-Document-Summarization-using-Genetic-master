3 The application for interlocutory relief first came before me on 24 February 2006 when the applicants sought ex parte orders in terms of paragraphs 1(b), 3, 4 and 5 of the Claim for Interlocutory Relief. They claim, in respect of each of those causes of action on the facts contained in the affidavit to which I have referred, that there is a real likelihood that unless restrained Mr Bunn will continue to infringe the trademark, commit the tort, and contravene the Trade Practices Act . The first applicant is licensed to use the 'IGA' name and mark in Australia.
