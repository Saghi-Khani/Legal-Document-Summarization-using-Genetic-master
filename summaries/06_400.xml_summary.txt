The Company, through the Administrators, applies for an adjournment of the hearing of the winding up application. 5 The Company relies on two affidavits sworn by Mr Wily: one sworn on 31 March 2006 and the other sworn today, 4 April 2006. If so, the effective contribution would be only $3296 rather than $103,000. I will call it 'Minto'. The question arises, why not? On 10 October 2005 the Company contracted to sell that shareholding to Linda Bernice Brickwood for $175,000. 13 Another matter raised by Mr Bavin, solicitor for the Commissioner, concerns uncommercial transactions.
