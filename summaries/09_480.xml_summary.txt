THE TWO APPEALS  On 17 March 2009, the appellant filed a Notice of Appeal in the IRCSA, appealing from "the Reasons for Decision" of Lieschke IM whereby his Honour found that the respondent was employed under the Clerks Award (the IRCSA appeal). Discontinuance of the appeal would alleviate both parties of attendance at tomorrow's directions hearing and any further costs in relation to the Federal Court appeal. It appears to have considered the competency of the appeal only the day before the hearing of the stay motion. The respondent sought costs. "Judgment" is not defined in the FW Act.
