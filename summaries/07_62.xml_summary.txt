In this case, the Tribunal advised the Appellant that it was unable to be satisfied that the Appellant held a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason and invited the Appellant to attend a hearing, give oral evidence, make submissions and nominate any additional witnesses from whom the Tribunal might be invited to seek and obtain additional evidence. The Tribunal was under no obligation to seek further information from the Appellant in assessing whether the Tribunal could reach the required state of satisfaction. On 1 August 2003, a Delegate of the First Respondent refused that application.
