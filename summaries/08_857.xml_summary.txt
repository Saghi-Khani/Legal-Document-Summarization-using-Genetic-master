5 The Department prepared a detailed paper discussing the issues relevant to the Minister's consideration of whether to cancel Mr Tapel's visa. 2 On 30 April 2007 a notice of intention to consider cancellation of his visa under s 501(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) was sent to Mr Tapel at the Long Bay Correctional Complex. Those in favour of cancellation were the protection of the Australian community and its expectations. No such application was made at the hearing. Page 7 of the letter sets out in detail the documents which the applicant recognised receiving.
