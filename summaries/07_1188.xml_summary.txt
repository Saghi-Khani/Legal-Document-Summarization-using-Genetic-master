Clause 2.43(2)(b) of the Regulations relevantly provided, prior to 8 October 2005, that for the proposes of s 116(3) the Minister must cancel a Student (Temporary) Class TU visa if satisfied that the visa holder has not complied with condition 8202. Relevantly it noted that the appellant's enrolment at St Augustine's College had been terminated on 31 March 2005 by reason of serious misconduct and failure to meet course requirements. It would be futile to grant such leave. 9 The appellant applied to the MRT for a review of the delegate's decision.
