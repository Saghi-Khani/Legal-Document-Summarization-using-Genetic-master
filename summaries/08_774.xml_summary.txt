One matter of controversy relates to a number of documents which were submitted to the Tribunal by the appellant in support of the application and these documents are relied upon by the appellant as powerful, it is said, corroboration of the oral evidence of engagement in the events of 7 May 2004 and 8 May 2004 and thus a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason. The Federal Magistrates Court failed to follow the procedural fairness when making its decision. That matter involved an assessment by the Tribunal of material properly before it.
