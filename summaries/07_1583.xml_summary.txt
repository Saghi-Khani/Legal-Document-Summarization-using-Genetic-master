The first charge relates to evidence the defendant gave a member of the ACCC on 28 February 2006. He also has two grandchildren. 48 Section 20AB(1) of the Crimes Act provides for additional sentencing alternatives. It follows that for the present two offences the maximum number of hours of community service that can be ordered is 400 hours. I regard the offending conduct as serious.
