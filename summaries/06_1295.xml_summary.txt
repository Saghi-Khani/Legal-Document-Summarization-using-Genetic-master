I am of opinion that the Tribunal did take into account the fact that the appellant had not given evidence in support of her claims, and the fact that she did not attend the hearing, as information to why it would find against her. It is not clear how the Applicant would practice Falun Gong if she returns to China. 46 Last, it is said that the Tribunal failed to exercise a discretion under s 426A(1) in accordance with the Act and thereby committed a jurisdictional error. For these reasons I reject this ground.
