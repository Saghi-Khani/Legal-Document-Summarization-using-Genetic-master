The Tribunal's reasons state:  The Tribunal considered the applicant's associated claim that he may be targeted by persons he arrested during his SLA service. The Tribunal finds that he does not have the profile of an individual who will attract the adverse interest of Hezbollah or any one else in Lebanon because of his former association with the SLA. Ground 2  14 The appellant claimed that the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by failing to consider whether the appellant's fear of persecution was well-founded. Any questions or comments? The appellant was subsequently taken to immigration detention.
