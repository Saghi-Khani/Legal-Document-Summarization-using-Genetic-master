30 As a matter of commonsense, if Comcare wished the AAT to find that the Northern Territory Buddhist Society would probably offer a retreat with similar benefits in Alice Springs, more evidence in support of that assertion was desirable. This appeal turns upon whether it was reasonable for Mr Holt to undertake the retreat in the circumstances. Section 16(1) of the SRC Act does not indicate that a proposed treatment is reasonable unless alternative treatment of more or less equivalent therapeutic benefit and at a lesser cost is shown by Comcare to be available. The AAT accepted his evidence.
