I would also reject the contention that, because of the terms of his 2005 statutory declaration, he "gave" the information in his initial statement to the Tribunal for the purposes of its review. This omission was one of the reasons advanced by the Tribunal for rejecting the appellant's evidence that he was known as an Indian leader and that demonstrators had gathered at his house. The Tribunal member raised the question of whether this claim had earlier been made. This information was said to be relevant because it indicated some inconsistent account relating to the appellant's claims.
