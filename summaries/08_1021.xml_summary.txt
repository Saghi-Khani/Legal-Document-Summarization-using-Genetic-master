9 I propose to make an order in terms of the s 23 orders which are sought by ASIC in its interlocutory process relevant to Mr Carey and subject to certain variations. 1 In these proceedings which were commenced in the Victorian Registry of the Court, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), exercising its powers under s 50 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act), has brought an action in the name of Ann Street Mezzanine Pty Ltd (in liquidation) (Ann Street) against a number of defendants, including Norman Phillip Carey.
