Jenkinson J ordered that the respondent-cross-claimants pay the cross-respondents' costs of the cross-claim. They sought indemnity and/or contribution from Mr Fenwick and Morocco Holdings. Claims for unconscionable conduct, misleading or deceptive conduct, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence were all made on the basis of the Varied Tender Proposal. The cross-claim in the present case related principally to one aspect of the many claims which the first applicant, in particular, brought against the respondents. Written submissions were filed pursuant to the liberty given. No order for costs. The application against the owners was dismissed.
