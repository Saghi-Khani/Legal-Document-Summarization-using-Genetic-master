This applies to claims 1---3 of the Patents Nos 2 and 3 only. 65 Issue 17: Does the claimed roadside post involve an innovative step over information made publicly available in relation to a prototype steel post developed by Mr Dennison and Mr P Turner in Tasmania? That included the use of PVC material. The cross-claim and particulars of invalidity were filed by Dura-Post on 5 May 2006. That is a different material from sheet spring steel and, for the reasons referred to in relation to the SupaFlex post, there is an innovative step.
