8 The fourteenth respondent is the Victorian Registrar of Titles. 10 Gillard J gave further consideration to the exercise of the Court's discretion to make an order under s 103 of the Transfer of Land Act in Marshall v Williams [1974] VR 592. This consideration does not arise in the present proceeding because it is accepted by all parties that the duplicate certificates of title relating to the relevant properties are held by the Registrar. 5 Having heard argument on 5 December 2007 I made the orders sought in paras 1 and 2 of the notice of motion.
