25 Dr Edwards' evidence, as summarised above, is entirely consistent with the conclusion of the Tribunal that the Statement of Principles concerning Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (dated 12 August 2003) is a Statement of Principles under subsection 196B(2) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in respect of the kind of death suffered by Mr Brown (see s 120A of that Act). Nor was Dr Edwards asked to express an opinion on whether ischaemic heart disease otherwise accelerated Mr Brown's death. 39 I therefore turn to the appeal under s 44(1) of the AAT Act. I do so.
