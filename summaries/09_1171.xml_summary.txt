In the present case, the second respondent acted under O 46 r 7A(1). The Registrar's power to seek the direction of a Judge is thus conditional on the Registrar forming the opinion that the relevant document on its face is an abuse of the process of the Court or is frivolous or vexatious. The applicant appealed from those orders to the Federal Court. The first respondent was the petitioning creditor in the applicant's bankruptcy. A sequestration order and other orders were made by Smith FM on that day ( NAB Limited v Satchithanantham (No 2) [2009] FMCA 229).
