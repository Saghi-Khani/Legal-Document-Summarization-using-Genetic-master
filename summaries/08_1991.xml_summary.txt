Storm says the letter of 9 December 2008 is misleading because Storm was not required to and did not manage the Bank's margin loan facility with its customer. Mr Cassimatis says it was not so as a matter of practice. If the client borrower did not respond to the margin call, the Bank would take action to sell the underlying securities. Margin lending facilities were offered to clients through financial advisers. We may at any time remove an investment from our list of securities.
