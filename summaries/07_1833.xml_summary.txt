1 This is an appeal against an order of a Federal Magistrate made on 23 July 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) made on 3 August 2005. The Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse to grant a visa to the appellant. It is clearly a jurisdictional error to make a judgment before all the evidence in relation to the case was carefully examined. The delegate was not satisfied that the appellant and her sponsor were in a genuine spousal relationship.
