Ms Huang does not suggest that Professor Winder touched her at any other time. 94 Federal Magistrate Driver said that he found Ms Huang's allegation of discrimination on the ground of disability to be unclear. The literature review was re-submitted on 30 November 2001 and both Dr Markovic and Professor Winder provided comments. His Honour noted, and Ms Huang repeats, that Dr Markovic did not engage in sexual harassment but indicated a sexual interest in her. She asserts that she was victimised because she complained of her medical condition. Ms Huang made two relevant complaints to HREOC.
