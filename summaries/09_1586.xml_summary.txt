The CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements were signed by the parties around the time of those visits: the CHEC Framework Agreement on 1 October 2004 and the CMCC Framework Agreement on 20 October 2004. By materiality I refer to the question whether the Informations constituted information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. That article asserted that the framework agreements did not bind the Chinese Contractors to build the Project infrastructure. FMG had entered into the CREC framework agreement. MR HEYTING: Yes.
