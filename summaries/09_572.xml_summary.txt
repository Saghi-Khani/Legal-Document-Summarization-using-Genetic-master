Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Contract Blinds Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 572 (28 May 2009) In his affidavit of 23 April 2009, Mr Reidy deposed that, based on the agreed amount of settlement, the second applicant and the group members would recover 85.15% of their claims. I turn now to consider whether settlement of the proceeding ought to be approved under s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act . Any of the group members not attending the meeting was to receive the Opt-Out Notice (with an appropriate translation) by personal service.
