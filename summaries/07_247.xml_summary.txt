1 On 2 February 2007, I made a declaration that the respondent ('the University') had breached cl 6 of Sch D of The University of Western Australia Academic Staff Agreement 2004 ('the 2004 certified agreement') and imposed a penalty upon the University. Section 824 became effective on 27 March 2006. 2 The applicant contends that there were acts or omissions by the University in the course of the proceeding which were 'unreasonable' within the meaning of s 824(2) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the Act') and which caused him to incur costs in connection with the proceeding.
