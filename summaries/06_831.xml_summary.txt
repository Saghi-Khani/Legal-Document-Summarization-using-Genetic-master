In my opinion it is not in the interests of justice for the fifth respondent to be permitted to make the submission of no case to answer, unless it elects that it will not call evidence. 2 In this case there are two principal claims affecting the fifth respondent, the circumstances giving rise to which, albeit spread over various periods of time, occurred early in the calendar year 1999. 4 This application has been made, as Mr Wood frankly conceded, without any notice to the applicants. In the case before Sackville J, two days were said to be saved.
