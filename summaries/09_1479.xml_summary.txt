Projects 5 and 6 could not be irrigated from the Lagoon because there was no pipe work across Speers Creek to convey the water to those Projects. Members were each to enter into a "Grove Licence Agreement" (with COGL) which would give the Member a licence to use and occupy a 0.2 ha Grove. The primary obligation of AOHL is provided for in cl 4.1(a), (b) and (c). The first obligation was to pay AOHL the fees provided for in the CWSA. I will call the Water Land "Lot 11". That water was not supplied by AOHL.
