INTRODUCTION  1 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court given on 14 September 2007, dismissing an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal'). The Tribunal was satisfied that there was no "real chance that [the appellant] would be subject to serious harm amounting to persecution for a Convention reason (including his particular social group, actual or imputed) because of the current political difficulties in Bangladesh". 6 The Tribunal considered the history of the appellant's claims. Ground 5 also fails. It was not satisfied that the appellant was homosexual.
