MZXMC v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2007] FCA 768 (18 May 2007) 2 The basis upon which the Federal Magistrate dismissed the application to review was the failure of the appellant to appear on the day of the hearing. 3 The respondent Minister has filed a notice of objection to competency. Further, pursuant to O 52 r 5 of the Federal Court Rules leave to appeal must be sought within 21 days of the pronouncement of the interlocutory decision, and the appellant must also obtain an extension of time. There was, however, no medical certificate attached to the letter.
