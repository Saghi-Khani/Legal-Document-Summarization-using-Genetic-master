Mr Bigmore said that the 9 September notice • was not the "formal statement" required by s 222B(1)(b) ; • was not a written declaration of the applicant's state of mind, as distinct from Mr Cauchi's. 25 In any event, s 63B(1) provides that a trustee may by "signed writing" appoint a person to represent him or her at a meeting. 2 At a meeting of the respondent's creditors held on 30 September 2008 a resolution was passed purporting to terminate the PIA under s 222B(1) of the Act.
