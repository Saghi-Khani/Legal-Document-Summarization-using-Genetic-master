ORDERS  The Orders of the Court are: The Application for Leave to Appeal as filed on 20 May 2009 is dismissed. In the present proceeding, however, neither the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrate nor the proposed Notice of Appeal expose any basis upon which an appeal would have any prospects of success. The grant of an extension of time under this rule is not automatic. Justice in such circumstances does not require a dispensation from compliance with O 52 r 5(2). The applicant only made the briefest of claims.
