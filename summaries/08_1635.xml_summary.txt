15 On 13 October 2008, Mr Burnett-Smith received notice of a proposed extraordinary general meeting to be held on 1 November 2008 at which it was proposed to pass a resolution to "validate and ratify" the resolution passed at the EGM on 12 July 2008 removing the four directors. Section 203D(2) provides that notice of intention to move the resolution (to remove a director) must be given to the company at least two months before the meeting is to be held. Suzanne Ryan was present. The first and sixth respondents contend that no such resolution was passed.
