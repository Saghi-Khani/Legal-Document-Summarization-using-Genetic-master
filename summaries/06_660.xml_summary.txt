4 On 15 May 2003 the Board of the ACC made the Australian Crime Commission Special Investigation Authorisation and Determination (Established Criminal Networks) 2003 (the first Instrument). 1 This application challenges the validity of a summons issued under s 28 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2020 (Cth) (the ACC Act) by the third respondent to the applicant. Its functions under s 7A of the ACC Act include investigating, when authorised by the Board of the ACC, matters relating to 'federally relevant criminal activity'. Section 7C(1)(e) does not impose that task upon the Board.
