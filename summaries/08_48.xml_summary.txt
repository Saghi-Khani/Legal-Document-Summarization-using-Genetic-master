Introduction  1 A taxpayer whose objection to an amended assessment of income tax has been rejected by the Commissioner may appeal to this Court by filing and serving an appropriate application. Telstra also directly subcontracted the applicant to do some of the work under the Prime Contract. This involves consideration of the concept of being "at risk" in respect of R&D expenditure. The requirement of an appeal statement is directed to this end as is the obligation to provide particulars in response to a proper request for particulars, that is particulars of fact not of argument.
