The GST Act is a taxing statute. A declaration that the liquidator is not personally liable to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation for GST or any related general interest charge on the sale of Lot 8 under the sale contract of 27 August 2008. 51 Section 147-25(1) makes the tax period of a representative the same as that of the incapacitated entity. 5 The composite expression "a taxable supply" is of critical importance for the creation of liability to GST . An individual such as Mr Greig may, definitionally, also be an "entity". I do so for these reasons.
