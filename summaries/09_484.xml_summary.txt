As to whether the scheme is sufficiently fair and reasonable that an intelligent and honest shareholder acting alone might approve it, I am satisfied that this condition has been met. In this regard, I apply the decision of Lindgren J in Re APN News & Media Limited [2007] FCA 770 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 400. The first hearing was on 16 January 2009. At the meeting, the plaintiff's members voted overwhelmingly in favour of the scheme. The third matter is the presence in the scheme of a "no incumbrances" provision. The second matter related to the treatment of ineligible overseas shareholders.
