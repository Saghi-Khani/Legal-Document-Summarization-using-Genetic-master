By its letter of 29 May 2008, Harris Scarfe proposed orders which, in substance, acknowledged contravention of the TP Act in certain respects, including extending to contraventions beyond those found in the primary judgment and extending to the television advertising. It required a Court order in resolution of the issues. The relevant injunctive order which the ACCC sought, which was unlimited in point of time, has been limited to a period of three years. Moreover, the letter of 2 May 2008 made no offer for costs of the proceeding to that date. But such an offer should be reasonably considered.
