First, the plain meaning of the word "dismissed" is satisfied by the dismissal of an application following a trial. Those of present relevance are:  (a) The Wongatha Claim (WAD 6005/1998); (b) The Cosmo Newberry Claim (WAD 144/1998); and (c) The Wutha Claim (WAD 6064/1998). 3 On 5 February 2007, there were eight Native Title claimant applications before the Court for judgment. 1 The following are my reasons for an order that I made in each of these two proceedings on 12 March 2007, dismissing the proceedings. Sections 189A and 190 (4)(d) are concerned with applications.
