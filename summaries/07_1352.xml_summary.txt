(2) The submission must:      (a) address a matter mentioned in section 52E of the Act; and  (b) be relevant to the reasons recorded for making the amendment. For this reason I accept the submission of Roche that the decision taken by the Committee concerning orlistat at its February 2007 meeting was to remove it from Appendix H because of the potential for direct-to-consumer advertising to be misunderstood by consumers. In February 2006 the respondent, the National Drug and Poisons Schedule Committee ("the Committee") decided additionally to include orlistat in Appendix H of the Poisons Standard.
