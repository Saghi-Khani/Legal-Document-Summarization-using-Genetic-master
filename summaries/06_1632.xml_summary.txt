That is, the Tribunal considered that even if the appellant did belong to a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention, membership of that group is not the reason for his fear of persecution. It is not because of any political opinion, for example. The Tribunal has considered whether the [appellant's] actions in exposing the criminal activities of the gangsters might have reflected some political opinion on his part, or have given rise to him being imputed with such an opinion. These difficulties have lead applicants and tribunals into error. This is an appeal from that court.
