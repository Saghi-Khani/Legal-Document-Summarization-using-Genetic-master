The Tribunal's letter dated 20 May 2005 did not refer to a further invitation to attend a hearing, but simply invited the appellant to provide documents or information. On 9 March 2005 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant advising him that it had written to the Department asking it for its file so that it could review his application for a protection visa. The appellant appeals against that order. He did not take that opportunity. The Magistrate said that the Tribunal had before it the record of the delegate's decision.
