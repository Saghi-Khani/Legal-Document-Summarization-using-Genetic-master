28 Section 151AKA(10)(b) requires the Commission to consider any submission received from Telstra. It is also alleged that by reason of matters pleaded, including the alleged failure to have regard to Telstra's submission prior to the issue of the competition notice, the Commission failed to comply with its duty to accord procedural fairness and natural justice to Telstra in connection with its decision to issue the competition notice. The Commission accepts that, factually, such information was not provided. Telstra is not entitled to the documents sought on discovery in respect of the consultation notice.
