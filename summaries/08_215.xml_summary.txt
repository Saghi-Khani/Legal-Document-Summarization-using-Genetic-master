Noting that the Court had jurisdiction under s 39B of the Judiciary Act and under ss 476A(1)(b) or (c) of the Migration Act , his Honour observed at [8] that there was no right of appeal under s 44 of the AAT Act because of s 483 of the Migration Act . Section 476(2)(b) provides that the Federal Magistrates Court has no jurisdiction in relation to:  a privative clause decision, or purported privative clause decision, of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on review under section 500. I reject that submission. The applicant does not contend to the contrary.
