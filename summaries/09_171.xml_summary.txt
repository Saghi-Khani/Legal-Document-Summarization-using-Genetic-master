In [47] of its reasons for decision, the Tribunal made a clear finding that the injury to the applicant's shoulders, coupled with the other factors it identified that were not war-caused, played a part in preventing him from continuing to undertake the remunerative work that he was previously undertaking. The Tribunal then addressed the cause of the applicant's incapacity for work, particularly the application of the "alone" test, found in s 24(1)(b) and (c) of the VE Act. By s 14(1), a veteran may make a claim for a pension.
