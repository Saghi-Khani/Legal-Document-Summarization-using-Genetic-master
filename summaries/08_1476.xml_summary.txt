For reasons given below I have concluded that the construction for which the respondent contends is correct, namely, that where the specification filed in respect of a parent application discloses the invention claimed in a divisional application based on the parent, the "complete application" to which cl 2.2(1A) refers is the divisional application. Clause 2.3(1A) stipulates that the prescribed period is "the period of 12 months after the information [that is the information referred to in s 24(1)(a)] was first made publicly available". 2005244456 ( Standard Patent Application ). 2005244456 ( Standard Patent Application ).
