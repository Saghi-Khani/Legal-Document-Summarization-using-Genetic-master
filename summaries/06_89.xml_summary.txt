CZAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 89 (13 February 2006) 2 The Federal Magistrate's decision was made against a background in which the applicant had already litigated, in the Federal Magistrates Court, the Federal Court of Australia and the High Court, the question of whether the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error in affirming the delegate's decision. 4 The applicant has not appeared at the hearing today. 5 In my opinion, if time was extended and leave given, it is highly unlikely that the appellant would have any prospects of succeeding in the appeal.
