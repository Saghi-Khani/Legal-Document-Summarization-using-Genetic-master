4 An appeal to this Court from conviction of an offence under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) lies pursuant to s 131B(2)(a). I am satisfied that Mr Vu knows he must be punished. 2 At his sentencing hearing before the Local Court Mr Vu did not give evidence. He also pointed out to the police (when they executed the search warrant) where the counterfeit DVDs were and made admissions as to hiring them out. I agree. DVDs have largely replaced videos as a means of viewing films. The penalty was payable in monthly instalments over a protracted period.
