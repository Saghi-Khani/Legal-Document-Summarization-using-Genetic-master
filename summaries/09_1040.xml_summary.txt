The Court has previously made declarations of contravention that reflect these findings: see Cahill v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 3) [2009] FCA 52. INTRODUCTION  The Court has found that Bob Mates, in his own right, and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, through Mr Mates' conduct, contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) on 15 February 2006, 17 February 2006 and 21 February 2006. These factors are relevant in this case. It would be inappropriate to order the applicant to pay any portion of the respondents' costs.
