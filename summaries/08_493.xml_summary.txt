Subsection 43(2) of the Act provides:  Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court or Judge. AIA submits that these circumstances justify the making of an indemnity cost order. The applicants' claims relating to the issue of the receipts and of the computer records should never have been raised (see Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons per Sheppard J at 233). The Court found that their testimonies were unreliable, and in respect of Mr Xu, false. 19 The initial hearing commenced on 27 August 2007 and continued until 11 September 2007.
