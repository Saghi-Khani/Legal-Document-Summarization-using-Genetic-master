His Honour considered the material in the outline of submissions to which he referred (see: [2005] FCA 1655 at [6] ). Before the court makes a decision you may make such written submissions in the English language as you wish on the question of whether the court should make an order nisi . For these reasons I refuse the application for leave to appeal. (REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT)   1 This is an application for leave to appeal from the decision of Sackville J in Applicant S231/2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2005] FCA 1655 given on 17 November 2005.
