' According to Mr Cox, the University also understood, based on the dates of the patent applications referred to earlier, that SIRT 1 was an invention developed subsequent to the SIR-Spheres invention (SIRT 2) which is pleaded in par 12 of the statement of claim and which was developed after Dr Gray ceased to be employed by the University. A motion by Sirtex Medical Limited (Sirtex) filed on 11 September 2006 for leave to amend its further amended defence and cross claim against Dr Gray and the Cancer Research Institute Incorporated (CRI). There is no registered patent.
