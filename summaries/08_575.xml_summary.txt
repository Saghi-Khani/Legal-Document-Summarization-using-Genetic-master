4 After 13 March 2008, Mr Slade made public statements to various media bodies concerning the anticipated amount of damages he thought the Court might award if Jarra Creek were successful in the proceeding. In addition, Maurice Blackburn offered an undertaking to the Visy parties that it would not in the future say that the ACCC alleged an overcharge of between 8 and 23 per cent. 18 In my view, the statements by Mr Slade are capable, on one reading, of misleading group members.
