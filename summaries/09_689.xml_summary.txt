(iii) In relation to 2(b), the primary judge made an error of fact by failing to find that the Respondent treated the Appellant differently from another person without the imputed disability in circumstances the same or not materially different from the Appellant. Mr Luiker's report of 28 May 2006 upon his psychological assessment of the appellant of 10 May 2006 did not mention hypochondriasis. Ms Hall did not act as she did on 9 May 2006 because she had imputed to the appellant a violent personality (at [92]). ORDERS SOUGHT:  The Appeal allowed. So did her work performance.
