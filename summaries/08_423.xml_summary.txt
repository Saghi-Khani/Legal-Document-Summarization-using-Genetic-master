1 These reasons relate to the respondents' (Adultshop's) recent and urgent motion to dismiss these proceedings due to non compliance by the applicant (Capital) with an order that it pay into court $68,000 by way of further security for Adultshop's legal costs. The evidence about that payment is adduced not to demonstrate that Capital was able to find those funds but rather to clarify that the payment was made at a time before any order was made by this Court for security for costs to be paid (that order being foreshadowed in reasons on 30 January 2008).
