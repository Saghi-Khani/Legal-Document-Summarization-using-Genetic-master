The trial judge said that the applicant's claim to a writ of mandamus compelling the tribunal to hear and determine his case according to law was foredoomed to fail. (REVISED FROM THE JUDGMENT)  1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of the Federal Magistrates Court dismissing an application to review a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (given on 17 January 2008) that it had no jurisdiction in the matter: SZIIG v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FMCA 344. The current challenge is a further attempt to attack the 2006 decision of the tribunal.
