The claim group of the proposed application is inconsistent with the claim group of the original application and cannot, therefore, be a sub-group of that original claim group. The basis of that application is an interest as a holder of native title rights or as a person authorised by those who assert native title over the Port Stephens land. After Worimi obtained pro bono legal assistance, joinder of Mr Hillig to the Worimi proceedings was not opposed. I accept that Mr Dates should be given the opportunity to present his case.
