Nor do I think that I should rule on the present argument that a feature described in the Provisional Specification, or an integer within a claim of the Patent cannot also be information relating to the Nasal Mask for the purposes of para (b) of Schedule 2 to the Licensing Agreement. I agree with ResMed that the University must plead facts showing "the connection" it alleges between the discoveries and improvements identified in Annexure A to the SFASOC and the particular aspects of the Intellectual Property. There is no other reference to Letters Patent anywhere in cl 11.
