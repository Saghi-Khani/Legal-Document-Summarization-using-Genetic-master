In that application and on appeal, Mr Skyring again agitated his contention that by s 36 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 (Cth), the Commonwealth has made notes rather than gold and silver coin legal tender in payment of debts throughout Australia in contravention of s 115 of the Constitution . 41 Accordingly, there is no power in the Federal Court to re-open orders of the Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction once perfected by entry. 12 Neither Mr Skyring nor the respondent took any step to resolve those matters. Leave to issue the writs must be refused.
