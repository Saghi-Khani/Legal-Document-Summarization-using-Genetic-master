In relation to PA 759725 the question is whether the claims in PA 759725 as amended on 4 March 2003 are fairly based on matter disclosed in the Specification of PA 716550 as filed . When the earlier application refers to an adjustable reflector device it is drawing a distinction between devices such as a "Chinaman's hat" reflector and the reflector device which is the invention with a resilient reflective skin which can be flexed to form a double parabolic shape. The requirement of the orthogonal positioning is not a limiting consideration. I now turn to consider the appeals.
