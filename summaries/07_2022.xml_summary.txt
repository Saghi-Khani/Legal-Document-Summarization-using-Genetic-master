28 On 24 August 2003, Pavana was attached to swing mooring number 60, one of the moorings that forms part of the Point Piper marina. SECTION 74(1) OF THE TRADE PRACTICES ACT  62 Mr and Mrs Ruaro contend that the Mooring Agreement contained an implied term that all services to be provided by Holmeport pursuant to the Mooring Agreement would be provided with due care and skill. Mr Holmes: Yes. Mr Ruaro gave no evidence of any such understanding. There will be a risk that they will drag, depending on the vessel and the conditions.
