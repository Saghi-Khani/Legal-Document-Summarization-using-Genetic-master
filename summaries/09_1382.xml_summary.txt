The substance of this relief is that QTAC be restrained from taking any action against Ms Jones, including terminating her employment, until the hearing of the substantive application. I form this view for the following reasons: 1. The second limb concerns Ms Jones' claim that QTAC has acted in breach of the terms and conditions of her employment contract. From August 2007 until 18 September 2009 the Chair of the Board of QTAC was Mr Colin McAndrew. This may very well be the case. On 25 August 2009 the ASU wrote to QTAC regarding the complaints made against Ms Jones.
