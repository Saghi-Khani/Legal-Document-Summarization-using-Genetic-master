Mr Wong says she suggested that Logic take up insurance which "Storage King" could provide. 6 On 1 March 2006, Logic arranged to rent three further storage spaces from "Storage King Cheltenham" at the same site, namely Units 14, 21 and 86. In addition, Logic says that Tokio cannot rely on any exclusion clause contained in the insurance contract to avoid liability in respect of the theft of the stored goods. WAS TOKIO LIABLE AS PRINCIPAL TO MIRABELL IN RESPECT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE? As noted above, goods stored by Logic at the Cheltenham premises included tyres in bulk.
