Those notices required the production of documents by 17 December 2008. Those proceedings concern the validity of notices issued under s 29 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth). A. B. Pty Limited v Australian Crime Commission [2009] FCA 119 (19 February 2009) Counsel for the Applicant properly did not contend otherwise. UNCERTAINTY  The contention that the notices are not authorised, or beyond such power as is conferred by s 29 , by reason of the uncertainty as to the documents required to be produced must be rejected. Subsection 5(c) likewise does not employ the language of " specified " things.
