5 By notice of motion dated 8 July 2005 Mr Maher sought orders setting aside the Registrar's order, made on 9 February 2005, and the two certificates of taxation issued on 4 November 2004. "  The applicant, Mr Maher, appeared in person before Jessup J. They related to orders which had been made by the Court on 26 September 2001 and the orders made by Finkelstein J on 2 and 5 February 2004. In these circumstances I do not consider that the costs order which I will make should include the respondents' costs incurred on 22 March 2007.
