I certify that the preceding four (4) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Kiefel. (COSTS)  1 These proceedings were dismissed on the first day of hearing on the Commissioner's concession. Litigation is often conducted on alternative bases and upon issues which cannot all be successful. This followed a motion by the applicants in each case to strike out certain allegations in the Commissioner's Amended Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions as irrelevant. They submit that the Commissioner has not acted as a model litigant in pursuing these actions.
