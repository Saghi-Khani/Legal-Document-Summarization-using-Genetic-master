Section 23(2) of the Australian Securities Commission Act 1989 (Cth) gave the inspector particular powers to give directions to an examinee's legal representative during the course of an investigation. 10 The written notice under s 52 of the Act given to B and a record of his examination on 9 November 2005 were tendered in evidence before me. 14 The respondent heard submissions from Ms Boots and from counsel assisting him. This would prejudice the investigation. Nor is there an express provision in the Act conferring on an ABC Commissioner the power to make a non-disclosure direction.
