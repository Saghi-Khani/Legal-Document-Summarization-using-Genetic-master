The federal magistrate refused to exercise the discretion to go behind the judgment. The learned federal magistrate dismissed an application by the appellants to set aside a bankruptcy notice. His Honour did not determine whether there was or was not a substantial reason to question whether the judgment of the County Court was in respect of an actual debt. The appellants engaged the respondent to act for them in litigation with another party or parties. Manifestly, this Court does not sit on appeal from the County Court in relation to judgments for debts. The appellants are litigants in person.
