Case 2 In about November 2005, the first and third respondents represented to the applicants that lots in the Middleton Shores development were not selling and that the applicants should acquire lots within the project with loan funds that the first respondent would arrange on their behalf. In the further alternative, they seek an order that the applicants provide particulars of a number of allegations in the statement of claim. As to paragraphs 71.3 and 75, the objection is that the pleas are not of material facts. The applicants acknowledge this and they seek discovery before particulars.
