The subpoena required production of all documents relating to any use of the "HUGGIE" MUMMY trade mark in Australia or intention to use or authorise the use of the mark. 16 The opponent distributes its goods throughout Australia using many channels. 41 The same considerations are relevant to the question of deceptive similarity.
