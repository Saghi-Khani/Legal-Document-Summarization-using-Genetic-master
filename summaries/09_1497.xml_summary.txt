According to Mr Trewin he also decided on 17 November 2009 to issue the further notice pursuant to s 264 requiring Mr Krok to attend and give evidence on 16 December 2009. The Commissioner, however, submitted that the relevant decision not to postpone the time requirement in the further notice was made by Mr Trewin, as recorded in para 10 of his affidavit; further, that the decision as made is recorded in the letter of 27 November 2009 from the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to Mr McKeough. His reasons are rational and cogent. BZ: No, we are not.
