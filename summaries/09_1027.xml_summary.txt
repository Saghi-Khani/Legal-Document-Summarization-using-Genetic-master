Explanatory Memorandum for the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Bill 2007:   " Items 1, 3, 4 and 6  Subsections 28(1) and 29(1) of the ACC Act provide that an examiner may summon a person to appear before them at an examination, or require that a document or thing be produced to them at a specified time and place. In this case, the applicant did appear before the examiner who had issued the summons. The examiner must also record in writing the reasons for the issue of the summons. I reject the fourth ground of challenge to the notice to produce.
