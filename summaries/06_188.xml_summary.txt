42 As I read the Tribunal decision, there were two elements to the appellant's claims of persecution due to race: the personal claims and the offences committed against the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. 7 Ms Rider and Mr Mitchell were the advisers. 54 The Tribunal did err in concluding that persecution because of a characteristic of a racial group does not attract the protection of the Convention. Such failure constitutes jurisdictional error. 47 The appellant described and the Tribunal accepted the appellant's claimed discrimination by reason of her religion. Conclusion  52 The Tribunal did not demonstrate apprehended bias.
