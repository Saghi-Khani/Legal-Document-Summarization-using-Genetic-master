First, Finance claimed as a deduction the amount written off pursuant to s 25-35 of the 1997 Act. Finance, the internal financier to the BHPB Group, financed projects approved by the board of directors of BHPB both initially and on an on-going basis, including projects constructed and operated by BHPDRI and BHPTM. It is the writing off by Finance of these parts of the two debts (the BHPDRI loan and the BHPTM loan) in the 2000 year which is in issue in these proceedings.
