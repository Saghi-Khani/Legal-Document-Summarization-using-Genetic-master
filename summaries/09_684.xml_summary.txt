Smith v Commonwealth of Australia [2009] FCA 684 (24 June 2009) This amount is recoverable from the lump sum compensation paid to Mr Smith in relation to his disability pension under section 30C of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA)...  ... The facts recounted above compel a negative answer to that question because the pension was being received in respect of an injury caused by Mr Smith's war service in Vietnam. Secondly, for what did the amount recovered as common law damages compensate the veteran? The respondent must pay the applicant's costs of the application to this Court.
