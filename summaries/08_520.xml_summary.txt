In June 1999 he was an unlawful non-citizen who had been detained in immigration detention at Villawood Immigration Detention Centre (Villawood). Neither Mr Nicholls, the Departmental officer who made the decision that a NSW prisons official should be requested to take Mr Soh into custody, nor Ms Symons, the officer who implemented that decision, afforded Mr Soh procedural fairness before Ms Symons made the request. Further, any State law or administrative arrangement for such detention would also be invalid. 18 On 4 February 1999 an ACM employee observed Mr Soh involved in a fight at Villawood with another detainee.
