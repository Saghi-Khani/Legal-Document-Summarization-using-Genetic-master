In my opinion, in this case, the Tribunal properly addressed the issue of relocation within India. The Tribunal rejected this claim on the ground the appellants did not provide any independent information to show this claimed link. The Tribunal's conclusions with respect to adequate state protection were sufficient to deal with the appellant's application for review. I can find one reference in the appellant's evidence to a connection between the police and the CPI(M). This submission must be rejected. The appellant and his wife have been threatened over the telephone and at his business premises.
