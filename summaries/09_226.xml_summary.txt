This Act does not make any provision for the transferring bank to continue to exist or to be deemed to continue to exist. The transferring bank's liabilities as well as its assets become those of the receiving bank; s 13(1). At the time of the integration four partnerships existed between the Commonwealth Bank and the Savings Bank, who were the only members of those partnerships. Accordingly, the applicant claimed depreciation deductions for the 2003 income year by reference to the market value of the partnership assets upon consolidation. Section 22(3) purports to do no such thing.
