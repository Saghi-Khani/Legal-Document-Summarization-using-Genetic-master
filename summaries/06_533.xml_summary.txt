The Tribunal did not accept that the essential and significant reason for the persecution which the appellant fears was his membership of the particular social group for the purposes of the Convention constituted by his family. The Federal Magistrates' Court erred in making this finding. The Tribunal considered this claim and, on the basis of the evidence, rejected it. Also raised in the supplementary submissions and amended notice of appeal, is the issue whether the appellant's conduct manifested a political opinion. The Tribunal rejected this claim. Mr Zipser accepts that leave is required in relation this issue.
