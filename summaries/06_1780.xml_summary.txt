The Court may direct that the trial, or any part of the trial, be held at a place other than the proper place (O 30 r 6(2)). 8 For these reasons the application for the proceeding to be transferred to the Cairns Registry of the Court is dismissed. The respondent's solicitors are Gadens Lawyers, Cairns. However, in my view, the proceeding can presently be suitably conducted in Sydney. It is likely that the matter would be allocated to the docket of a Brisbane resident judge.
