The integrity of the court process is an important issue on which his Honour was entitled to place great weight. GMCA Pty Ltd v Black & Decker Inc [2007] FCA 1680 (2 November 2007) 6 The application for leave to appeal from the interlocutory judgment of Finkelstein J is refused and the appellant's motion dated 26 October 2007 is dismissed with costs. 3 I do not see any arguable case that his Honour's discretion miscarried. 5 This case is not concerned with particularly arcane technology, for expert evidence concerning which the parties might have to search throughout the world.
