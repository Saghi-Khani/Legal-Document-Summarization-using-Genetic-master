The exemption in s 7(2) is in terms of documents. (j) Internal and external correspondence in relation to complaints for the period from 1 September 2000 to 31 August 2002 in relation to Foreign Correspondent program coverage of the Middle East. Even if the category of documents specified is limited to tapes and recordings, the exemption both in the section and the Schedule is in relation to that program material. UTS supported that construction. For agencies except the ABC and SBS, the entry in the Schedule then describes the particular documents as ' documents in respect of [a particular activity]'.
