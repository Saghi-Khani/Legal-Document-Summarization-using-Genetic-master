1 The applicant Mr Alan Foster seeks an extension of time in which to appeal to this Court against a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (the Tribunal) given on 14 May 2008 (the second decision). The Tribunal in the first decision discussed the issue of the terminal illness requirement in these terms: 10 Mr Foster is not terminally ill. The problem, however, is that since 2004 the Act has limited portability of the DSP. (2) The Secretary may revoke the determination if any of the qualifying circumstances ceases to exist. Additionally, his country of origin is Australia.
