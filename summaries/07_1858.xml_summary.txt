First, information regarding Nepalese subjects not needing to obtain a visa to travel to India would be information falling within the s.424A(3)(a) exception to s.424A(1). 1 This is an appeal from the decision of Cameron FM dated 17 August 2007, dismissing an application seeking judicial review of a decision of the second respondent ("the Tribunal"). The Tribunal failed to consider whether the appellant had a well founded fear after finding there may be some "future incidents" of violence; and 2. Is this correct? I also accept that I departed Nepal in August 2005.
