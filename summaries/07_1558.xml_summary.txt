A letter was received from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission pursuant to s 411(17)(b). At the option-holders' meeting, 99.98 per cent of all votes cast, representing 96.55 per cent of option-holders in number, were in favour of the motion to approve the scheme. 1 On 23 August 2007, I made orders convening a meeting of the holders of the ordinary shares in Peplin Limited for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing to a scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between that company and its shareholders.
