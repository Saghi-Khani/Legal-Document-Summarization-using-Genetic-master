However, the RRT's finding of adequate state protection related to the claim with which it was dealing, namely the threat likely to be experienced by members of the Turkish armed forces and their families. However, the RRT considered whether the applicant was at risk of persecution by reason of his membership of a social group consisting of businessmen in Russia. One aspect of that determination was whether the subjective fear of persecution held by the appellant by reason of the blacklist claim was well founded. This constitutes a failure by the RRT to exercise its jurisdiction.
