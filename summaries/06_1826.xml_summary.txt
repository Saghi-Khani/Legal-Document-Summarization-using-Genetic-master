The trial Judge refused the application for the adjournment and proceeded to hear the matter. 5 The proceeding concerns a claim by the applicant that he advanced $750,000 in two separate loans to Mr Mercorella. Dr Wright was specifically asked whether Mr Sobey could give detailed instructions in relation to the action. 6 The joint receivers and managers and liquidators were appointed on 8 August 2005. That report was obtained after the hearing on 4 December 2006. He, therefore, made the orders to which I have referred and which are now sought to be stayed pending the appeal.
