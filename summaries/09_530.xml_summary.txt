Firstly, the Court's role on appeal is to determine whether the judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia reflects error on the part of that Court. In May 1999, the appellant joined the Social Welfare Organisation for Women ("SWOW") of Dir. The Tribunal in affirming the decision of the Minister's delegate reached adverse findings concerning the appellant's credibility. Section 427 enables the Tribunal to take particular steps in the conduct of a review. The letter advises that the appellant was to be discharged on 5 September 2008. Thus, the investigation was unauthorised.
