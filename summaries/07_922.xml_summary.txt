On 1 August 2005 York Street Mezzanine paid Mr Dunphy the face value of his promissory note by making that payment to Ann Street Mezzanine. I would, in any event, have followed the Court of Appeal for three reasons. The construction company was Ann Street Brisbane Pty Ltd. Each company also maintained detailed records of all dealings with the funds raised on the issue of promissory notes. There may, however, be an implicit agreement to that effect. Here the relevant scheme is not simply the issue of promissory notes by Ann Street Mezzanine.
