Reduced litigation costs in challenging HP Mercantile's right, title and interest to the loan debt due under the Investor Loan Agreement. The parties made submissions for and against the proposition that the arrangement established by the defendants constituted an unlawful MIS. TROM's Liquidator and Merilbah's Liquidators are officers of the Court. I appreciate that it can be said that the investor-debtors would not be aware of circumstances giving them a right to complain. Merilbah assigned the debts to HPM. Pending the final hearing no further solicitation of funds should take place.
