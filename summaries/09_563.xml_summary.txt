Overall, the Tribunal concluded that the appellant was not a witness of truth, rejecting all of his "material" claims as either an embellishment or fabrication. This indeed leads into the second part of the first ground, namely, that the Tribunal failed to have regard to whether the applicant might be persecuted for his perceived, imputed or actual political opinions, even if not strongly held. However, the evidence generally supports this finding. This also led the Tribunal to find that the appellant did not fear that he had a real chance of persecution between July 2006 and February 2008.
