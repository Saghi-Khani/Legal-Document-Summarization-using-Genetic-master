On 15 December 2005, the respondents wrote to the applicant, stating that Merkel J had required that they provide reasons for their motion to strike-out the Amended Statement of Claim. That paragraph, with particulars, was as follows:  On or about 4 March 2005 the respondents terminated the applicant's employment. 32 Otherwise, I do not propose to make costs orders based on what the applicant alleges were the respondents' unreasonable acts or omissions. The respondents' Defence to the Further Amended Statement of Claim was filed on 18 July 2006. It had nothing to do with without prejudice communications.
