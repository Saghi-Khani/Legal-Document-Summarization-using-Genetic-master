BUCHANAN J:  1 These are applications for leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment ( McDonald's Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 37) where the applicant ('McDonald's') sought relief at first instance that the primary judge described as novel. The assessment required, in a case of the present kind, is whether a party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending a proceeding. In fact, since the judgment under challenge was delivered, further amended appeal statements have been filed by consent. I decline to direct that it be heard and determined by a Full Court.
