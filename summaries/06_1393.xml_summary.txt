'      12 Questions of privilege arise in the circumstances. Associate:Dated: 25 October 2006 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr P W Flynn   Solicitor for the Applicant: Baker & McKenzie   The Respondent appeared in person. When the matter came before the Court at 5 pm, the proposed order requiring an affidavit to be filed and served by the respondent was modified and short minutes of order were handed up, which set out the modified form of order sought. It appears to me to have no application to a case like the present case. Neither authority, principle nor public policy would justify that.
