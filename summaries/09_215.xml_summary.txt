The applicants' change of position in relation to the definition of Group Members has rendered the second ground relied upon by the respondent in support of its Motion nugatory. The final hearing has been fixed to commence on 31 August 2009. The applicants submitted that because the respondent had abandoned its Motion, it should pay the applicants' costs of that Motion. The respondent resisted the making of any costs order against it. These proceedings were commenced on 9 October 2007. The claims by the group made in this case involve many common issues and many matters of fact.
