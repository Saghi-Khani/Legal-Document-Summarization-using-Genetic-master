He did not pay any money to the University in relation to the hypothetical. I accept the evidence of Ms Ellmers that she had only one telephone conversation with Mr Rana on 27 March 2006, and that she made no reference to Ms Willason or to payment at a place other than the Convention Centre. Ms Ellmers did not promise Mr Rana ten tickets or, indeed, any tickets. For this reason, his claim for an injunction should be refused. The email messages are said by Mr Rana to contain admissions by the University. I accept Ms McIver's evidence.
