In my view the contract does not constitute an essential element in the plaintiff's cause of action in negligence, and her tortious claim is "a demand in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract promise or breach of trust" within the meaning of s 82(2) of the Bankruptcy Act. IS LEAVE REQUIRED? As such, the claim would be provable despite being for unliquidated damages. 2 After the proceedings in the Supreme Court were issued, Mr Penkin became bankrupt. The set off cases therefore cast light upon what debts are provable in bankruptcy.
