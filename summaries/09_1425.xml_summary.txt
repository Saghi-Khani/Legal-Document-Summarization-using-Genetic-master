The applicant, Ms Lawrence, applies today for leave nunc pro tunc, pursuant to s 500(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (CA), to begin and carry on this proceeding. Considering those principles in the present situation, I am satisfied that the claims are serious, notwithstanding that they may, or may not be, hotly disputed particularly by the insurer. Costs reserved. Certain members of the group, including Ms Lawrence, have made demands for compensation during the period of insurance.
