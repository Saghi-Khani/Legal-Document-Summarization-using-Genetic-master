By notice of motion dated 9 September 2009 and made returnable this morning, the plaintiffs apply for orders under O 35A of the Federal Court Rules . In that statement of claim dated 31 July 2009, the plaintiffs allege - and I here refer to paragraphs 50 to 57 of the statement of claim --- that over a period of time, the First, Second and Third Defendants caused the Second Plaintiff to pay to the Sixth Defendant an amount of some $2.23 million. Mr Angeleri admitted that he controlled the Tenth Defendant's account into which the payments were made.
