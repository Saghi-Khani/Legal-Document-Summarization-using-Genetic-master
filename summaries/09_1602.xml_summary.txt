It is said that these commissions will flow into the company in the period January to March 2010. I give leave to Mrs Walters to appear on behalf of WR Estates Pty Ltd. She seeks a further adjournment of the matter. Accordingly, I propose to make an order that the defendant be wound up in insolvency under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and an order that a liquidator be appointed. I also directed Mrs Walters and her son to file affidavits deposing to the various matters which had been put to the court from the bar table.
