On 12 December 2006 Scarlett FM dismissed that application. The Tribunal is accordingly not satisfied that the applicant faced persecution in China because of Christian beliefs or that he faces persecution in China if he returns to that country. 25 The appellant did not provide any written submissions in support of the appeal. I declined to receive them. 2 On 21 April 2006 the appellant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the decision of the RRT. The criticisms which are made are of the conduct of the hearing by the RRT.
