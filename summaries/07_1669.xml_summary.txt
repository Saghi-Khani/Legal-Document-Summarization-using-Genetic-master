(3) The Franchise Owner must provide the changed or new services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notice given under clause 8.3(2) and this Agreement. It has not, however, required any of them to provide those services. That is likely to constitute an indirect involvement by McGrath Ltd, through a Related Person, McGrath Australasia, in the franchisee's property management business and thus be contrary to cl 13.1. Clause 13 has several purposes. The restraints protect the Run Property group's legitimate interests in the purchase of the McGrath group's rent roll business.
