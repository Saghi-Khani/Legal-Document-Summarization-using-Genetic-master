Deckers also claims to be the owner of copyright subsisting as original literary and/or artistic works in the sun device logo as depicted in Australian trade mark no. Deckers also applied for orders restraining Vladimir Vaysman, Victoria Vaysman and Hepbourne Pty Ltd from manufacturing, selling or offering for sale sheepskin products which bore the words "Ugg" or "Ugg Australia" or the sun device. It is not, therefore, possible to determine that any specific damage has been suffered by reason of the trade mark infringement. A similar complaint is made in relation to the sun device.
