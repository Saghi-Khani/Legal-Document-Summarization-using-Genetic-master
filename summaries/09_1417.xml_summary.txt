Australian Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union v Rail Corporation of New South Wales (No 2) [2009] FCA 1417 (3 December 2009) According to Mr Greenhalgh, after the employees rejected the station reform proposal in June 2006, RailCorp considered all vacant positions to be at risk of future abolition unless RailCorp specifically determined that the position should continue. By its actions RailCorp committed separate breaches of cl 22.1 with respect to those positions. RailCorp submitted that I should do so as all of the breaches related to cl 22.1 of the 2005 agreement. Some were ultimately filled.
