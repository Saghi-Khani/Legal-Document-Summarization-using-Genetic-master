8 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal clearly considered the appellant's claims. 21 The other ground which was argued was that the Tribunal had erred by failing to consider whether the appellant had been persecuted by reason of her membership of a particular social group. The evidence before the Tribunal was that the applicant and her ex-partner had two daughters born on 16 September 2003 and 16 September 2006. 14 The appellant sought leave to add additional grounds. The applicant herself gave evidence that their anger towards her was "mainly" because she wanted access to the children.
