4 Tamberlin J dismissed the applicant's application under O 80 r 4 with costs. Subsection 26(6) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) provides that a court shall not order the cessation of a detention which has lasted more than two months if the delay is for 'any ... reasonable cause'. On my view, the authority of the s 23 surrender warrant did not cease because the applicant was not transported out of Australia; his re-transfer into the custody of Australian authorities on 22 December 2007 and his continued custody by them since that date is therefore lawful.
