Further, and also of substance, is the fact that it is apparent that Mr Tait was, prior to that expert conference, and certainly prior to his giving evidence, seized with, in full, Dr Mallen-Cooper's statement. The paragraph, insofar as it does concern hearsay, does nothing more, in my opinion, than provide a foundation - an identified foundation - against which Dr Mallen-Cooper came to furnish particular advice. Again, though, at its highest, that lack of involvement would go to matters of weight. I overrule it. I, therefore, overrule that objection. He has, in his affidavit, recited that particular input.
