7 It is a requirement of s 472(2) of the Act that an application for winding up of the corporation has been made before the appointment of the provisional liquidator. The third respondent, PNF Management Pty Limited ("PNF Management"), has the same directors as PNF Systems, Mr Wilson having resigned on 30 March 2007. 19 Mr Wilson's evidence under cross-examination is unsatisfactory. In some other circumstances, such as where a company may be paralysed by a dispute between shareholders and directors or by an interim court order, there may also be grounds to appoint a provisional liquidator.
