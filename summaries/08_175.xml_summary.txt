Mr Kennett, who appears for the Minister, submits that the finding in the first sentence, which I have set out above, is limited to an assessment that there is a chance of serious harm. 5 The appellant is a citizen of Lebanon. 2 The decision of the Tribunal was dated 5 February 2007. 13 The Federal Magistrate found that the Tribunal had stated the real chance test properly and in accordance with the authorities. It accepted that there was currently inter-political conflict in Lebanon, which involved the LF as a part of the March 14 Coalition.
