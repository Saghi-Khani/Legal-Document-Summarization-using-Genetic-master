I note in passing that the material he exhibits from Termicide's web site refers to "termites", not to a particular species of termite. Scientific experiments performed on Termiglass in 2004 by Dr Don Ewart and by Dr John Holt in accordance with CSIRO protocols disclose that Termiglass provided no effective barrier to termites. 33 That is quite different to concluding that Granitgard has proved each or even any of the allegations it makes in the statement of claim. The first samples failed. 27 Dr Ewart carried out his own, informal testing of the two samples provided by Dr French.
