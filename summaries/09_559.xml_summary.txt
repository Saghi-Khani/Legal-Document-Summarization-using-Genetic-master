The Federal Magistrate dismissed an application for review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal which affirmed a decision of the respondent Minister's delegate refusing the appellant's application for a protection visa. The letter does not, in terms or substance, require a personal identifier. Specifically, in the third conversation Mr Wang told the appellant that the appellant needed to do "nothing" as Mr Wang would "look after everything else". The appellant did not attend the hearing before the Tribunal on 13 February 2008. The fact is that the appellant had not given any address to the Tribunal.
