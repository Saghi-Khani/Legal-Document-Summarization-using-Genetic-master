Snowy Mountains Organic Dairy Products Pty Ltd v Wholefoods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1361 (19 October 2006) The Dairy argued that if the matter were cross-vested to the Supreme Court of Victoria the result would still be that the two sets of proceedings would continue separately. 20 Wholefoods submitted on the present motion that there will be common issues of fact with those raised in the Victorian proceedings. And the Dairy asserts that the second Supreme Court proceedings are also part of that one controversy. 43 This Court is clearly able to hear and determine the claims in defamation.
