Further, the plaintiffs also seek relief pursuant to s 1322(4)(a) of the Act that the entry into the agreement and that the agreement itself are not invalid by reason of the failure of the plaintiffs to obtain any prior approval required by s 477(2B) of the Act. The agreement was for the disposal of the company's interest in mining tenements known as the "Mt Thirsty Tenements". 1 The plaintiffs are liquidators of the company, Shields Contracting Pty Ltd (the company). Mr Cribb deposed, and I accept, that the failure to obtain the approval occurred through inadvertence.
