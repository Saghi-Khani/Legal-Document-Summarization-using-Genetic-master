Further written submissions were filed and, when the hearing of the appeal resumed, the parties addressed on both the construction issue and the retrospectivity issue. Mr Perry says that the consideration by the Court of the retrospectivity issue, the issue before the Tribunal, was not necessary to the decision concerning his entitlements, determined by s 8(6) and its relationship to s 8(9B) of the SRC Act. Military Rehabilitation & Compensation Commission v Perry [2007] FCA 1862 (29 November 2007) 6 Mr Perry submits that the Commission should pay all of his costs of the proceedings.
