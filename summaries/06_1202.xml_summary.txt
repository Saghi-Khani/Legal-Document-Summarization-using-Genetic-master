On 25 November 2002, the High Court granted leave to a group of persons including the prosecutor to file an application seeking an order nisi. It is submitted by counsel for the Minister that the Tribunal has in its reasons indicated in various places that adverse material was put to the applicant, and that is correct. Applicant S1815 of 2003 v Refugee Review Tribunal [2006] FCA 1202 (29 August 2006) The assessment of the credibility of the applicant and the evidence presented by him was a matter for the Tribunal. It is not something I can make any order about.
