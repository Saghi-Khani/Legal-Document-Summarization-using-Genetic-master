On the evidence, we are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Byrne drowned, and that neither IHD nor CAD contributed to his death. Those opinions concluded that death was caused by such a cardiac event rather than by drowning. Mrs Byrne appeals the Tribunal's decision. Conclusion  17 There was detailed consideration of the evidence in the Tribunal's reasons. 12 The Tribunal proceeded to consider the applicable principles. It was that evidence which disproved the hypothesis that Mr Byrne's ability to survive in the water was impaired by war-caused CAD.
