It follows, so the appellant sought to argue, that the letter dated 6 October 2007 was incorrect in stating:  If the applicant decides to lodge a review application, they must do so within 21 calendar days after you receive this letter. The text of the section is clear. On the one hand the second sentence directs attention to time running by reference to the receipt of the letter. On the same day the delegate notified the decision. The appeal is therefore dismissed. However, s 66(1) has the function of stipulating that notification must be made in a certain way.
