There is no evidence suggesting that either Ilic or Benson provided any of the Icon Group directors or Parker with such a booklet prior to their proposed investment in Tiltform WA or their actual investment in Tiltform Australia. To understand these I will deal first with the questions of when and why Sladojevic, Bell and Benson were in Perth. I note in passing that Tripodi commenced work with Bell Chehade on 31 July 2000. Parker said it was with Benson. Bell given 5% shareholding of company in September 1999. He and later Sladojevic nonetheless participated in the meeting.
