Subsection 66-5(1) of the GST Act provides as follows:    If you acquire second-hand goods for the purposes of sale or exchange (but not for manufacture) in the ordinary course of business the fact that the supply of the goods to you is not a taxable supply does not stop the acquisition being a creditable acquisition. Or, as it is put by Mr Croes in his affidavit, the employees "sell their own motor vehicles to LeasePlan Australia in order to lease them back". They were not entitled to an input tax credit.
