4 The matter presently before the Court involves two motions on notice, one by the Lisa Ho respondents, and one by Smouha, seeking security for costs. Each fabric print designed by the applicant is sold to only one clothing designer or manufacturer in any given country in order to maintain the exclusivity of the applicant's fabrics. The Lisa Ho respondents and Smouha would prefer that the mediation not take place until evidence has been filed. Smouha's claim is for $150,000.
