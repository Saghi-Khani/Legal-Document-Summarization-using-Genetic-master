3 The Company was first registered on 8 December 1998 and its directors at that time were Mr Geoffrey Kenneth Woodham and Mr David John McLeod. 32 The issue for determination is whether, as the Company has only acted as a corporate trustee, the liquidator is entitled to have his remuneration costs, charges and expenses paid out of Trust assets. The Company was replaced as manager of the two partnerships by Fortia Funds Management Limited ("Fortia") in February 2005. The third beneficiary represented the McLeod interests. The liquidator was a necessary party involved in the winding up of the Scheme.
