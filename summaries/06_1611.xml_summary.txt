The second open offer made during the course of the hearing was for an amount of $500,000.00 plus interest. Rather, it is said that the Court should "otherwise order" within the meaning of O 23 r 11(5) having regard to disentitling conduct on the part of one or more of the defendants. Accordingly, a costs order in the plaintiffs' favour should be made in relation to this issue on a party-party basis. The plaintiffs respond that no Offer of Compromise in compliance with O 23 was made. None of these Offers of Compromise were accepted.
