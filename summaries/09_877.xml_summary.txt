An application for review was then filed with the Federal Magistrates Court on 18 September 2008. The Notice of Appeal , however, fails to identify any ground upon which it is said that the Federal Magistrate has erred. No such letter is referred to in that part of the Tribunal's reasons for decision which identifies the material available to it. Attention was thus given to the claim and the evidence in support. The now Appellant was invited on 8 May 2008 to attend a hearing to be held before the Tribunal on 6 June 2008.
