The appellant complains that the Tribunal failed to explain its reasons for not finding in the appellant's favour on the evidence before it. He claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution due to his membership of the Telugu Desam party. The fear of persecution must be related to a Convention reason, in this case, membership of a particular social group and/or political opinion. 3 The Tribunal was unable to satisfy itself, on the material before it, that the appellant might be persecuted as claimed. On 12 September 2005 he made application for a protection visa.
