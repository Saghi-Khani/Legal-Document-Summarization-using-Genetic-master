2 Section 588M of the Corporations Act is the present legislative expression of the circumstances in which the liquidator of an insolvent company may recover, from a director of that company, losses incurred by creditors during a period of insolvent trading. Any decision in that regard is reviewable under s 104(1) of the Bankruptcy Act . 52 That does not give the result that the proofs of debt lodged by the Liquidator, apparently including certain of the Company's liability to the Australian Taxation Office which also led to the penalty liability imposed upon the directors, are not properly made.
