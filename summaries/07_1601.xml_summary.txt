In that email, Mr Howard said that the giving of consent to OzEpulse to export wheat to Bangladesh would greatly enhance returns to growers. Further, I consider that the variation of the consents already given in respect of the export of wheat to Bangladesh and Italy required the agreement of the Minister before the Authority could give its consent to export in accordance with the proposed varied terms. Before making a variation, the Authority must consult AWB. What impact would approving an application have on the National Pool? However, the prohibition in s 57(1) does not apply to AWB.
