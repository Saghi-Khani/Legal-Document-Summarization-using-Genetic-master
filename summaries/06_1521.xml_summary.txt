4 On 15 April 2004 the appellant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking judicial review of the Tribunal's decision. The Tribunal noted that there were omissions of certain details which were inconsistent with a genuine fear of persecution. 2 The appellant is a citizen of Tonga. His Honour found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application. Section 475 of the Act was valid as it was ancillary to s 474. No particulars of either ground were provided. However, on the scheduled date of the Tribunal hearing, the appellant did not attend.
