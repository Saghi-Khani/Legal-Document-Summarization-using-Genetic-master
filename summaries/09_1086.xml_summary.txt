For present purposes it is sufficient to note that on 11 March 2002 Beaumont J made orders by consent, including the following two orders:   1. An inquiry was held and a Certificate subsequently issued by a Deputy District Registrar on 28 May 2009. An " objection " has been taken to this Certificate and the present proceeding before the Court is a " hearing " pursuant to O 39 r 10(3) of the Federal Court Rules . Mr Pantzer was appointed as the trustee of the estate. That was the figure being then advanced on behalf of Dr Wenkart.
