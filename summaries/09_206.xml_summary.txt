Mr Billy Brown and Ms Ida Brown are part of the Brown Family Group as defined in the original application. Note 2: Section 251B states what it means for a person or persons to be authorised by all the persons in the native title claim group. On 30 June 2008, the applicant filed an Amended Native Title Determination Application. The applicant claims that there was a meeting of the Brown Family Group on 8 November 2008. The test to be applied on an application under s 84C(1) of the NTA is clear. They were not evidence.
