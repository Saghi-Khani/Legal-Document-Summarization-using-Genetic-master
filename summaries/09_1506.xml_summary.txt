A person who has received a new card from Westpac will be able to use it at least for all the purposes he or she used the earlier Handycard. The MasterCard debit card system is not directly subject to the Reserve Bank's EFTPOS access scheme and standards. The Commission argued that the word "kind" in s 12DL(2) did not relate back to just whether the card was a credit card or a debit card. These were used to access funds in a customer's account with Westpac. It contended that these features amounted to a difference in kind.
