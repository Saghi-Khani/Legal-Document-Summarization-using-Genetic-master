The Federal Magistrates Court is specifically required not to make an order which has the effect of allowing an application outside the 28 day period where the application for extension is not made within 84 days of the actual notification. SZICO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 1803 (21 December 2006) It is evident that s 477 does not purport to preclude judicial review but imposes a limitation on the time for initiating that review. That finding is not challenged. 5 The applicants did not seek an extension of time within 84 days of 1 December 2005.
