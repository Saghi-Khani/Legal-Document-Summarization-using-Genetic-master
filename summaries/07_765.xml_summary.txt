That application was founded upon a claim of reasonable apprehension of bias by the Tribunal member because the same Tribunal member determined both the first and second decisions. 14 The Minister submits that the Act authorises the Tribunal to continue to review the decision to its conclusion even though the particular Tribunal member has determined the matter previously and relies upon Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj [2002] HCA 11 ; (2002) 209 CLR 597. Such notice sought to raise the same ground that had been abandoned before Scarlett FM. The appellant thereafter appealed to this Court.
