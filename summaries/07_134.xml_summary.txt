1 This is an application dated 18 October 2006 for an extension of time to file and serve a notice of appeal from an order of a Federal Magistrate made on 14 August 2006. In that decision, the Refugee Review Tribunal ('RRT') affirmed a decision of the delegate of the Minister not to grant the applicants protection visas. The applicant must pay the first respondent's costs of the application. The RRT rejected the applicant's claims as it was satisfied the applicant was not a witness of truth and gave four reasons for this finding.
