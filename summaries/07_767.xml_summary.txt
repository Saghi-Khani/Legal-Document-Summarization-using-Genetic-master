1 By notice of appeal filed on 8 March 2007, the appellant appeals from a judgment of Federal Magistrate Riley given on 21 February 2007. See generally MZWIK v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 185 per Sundberg J. The explanation may lie in the medical certificate which says simply that the appellant attended a medical practitioner on 16 May 2007 and was considered to be "unfit for work" on 17 and 18 May 2007. A decision to dismiss an application by reason of the absence of the applicant is a decision of an interlocutory nature.
