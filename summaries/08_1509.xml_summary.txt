I consider that no order should be made in favour of any party as to the costs of, and incidental to, the proceedings before Finkelstein J. If the rehearing was based upon the same evidence as before Finkelstein J, then in view of the result, it would be appropriate to make an order for costs in relation to the first trial in favour of the defendants. REQUISITIONED GENERAL MEETING  Bell requisitioned a general meeting, which has been effectively adjourned by reason of this proceeding and by order of the Full Court seeking to maintain the status quo.
