The Commissioner submits and I accept that she is not an adequate or appropriate contradictor of those matters. Order 6 rule 2(b) gives the Court a general and unconfined power and discretion to join a party as an applicant or respondent. 13 If Spirit were not joined and Pfizer were successful, fresh proceedings would result in an undesirable multiplicity of proceedings. Spirit has, however, affirmed its intention to commence rectification proceedings and proceedings for unjustified threats of infringement if denied joinder in this appeal. As to questions of law, this may well be the case.
