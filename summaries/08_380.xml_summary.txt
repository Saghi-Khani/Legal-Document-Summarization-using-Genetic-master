I listed Mr Tiata's application for hearing today. To that effect, last Friday 14 March 2008, a notice of discontinuance was signed by solicitors for both parties. The respondent is entitled to costs (see Order 22 rule 3(1) of the Federal Court Rules ) but in the absence of agreement to the amount of costs must establish the amount of costs to be awarded in the ordinary way. 5 In the present case submissions were filed on behalf of the Minister on 13 March 2008. No order was at that time sought for fixed costs.
