Section 4(1) of the Excise Act defines "Excisable goods" to mean "goods in respect of which excise duty is imposed by the Parliament, and includes goods the subject of an Excise Tariff or Excise Tariff alteration proposed in the Parliament". Section 114 precludes the commencement of proceedings for specified periods. The competing claims of Suntory and the Commissioner must be resolved by reference to the legislation. (9) There is presently no Excise Tariff alteration proposed before Parliament. The Senate rejected the Bill on 18 March 2009. Such a permission may be subject to conditions (s 61C(3)).
