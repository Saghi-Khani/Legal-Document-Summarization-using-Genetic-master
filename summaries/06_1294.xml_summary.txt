Because the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal had fallen into error in relation to the question of state protection, it seems to me the Tribunal's decision cannot stand. The finding of relocation therefore was made in the absence of the Tribunal first considering one of the integers of the appellants' claims, namely a fear of persecution by reason of religion. To be considered persecution the discrimination must be motivated by an intent to harm. In mid 1990 the appellant husband was robbed by masked men on returning from work. They have relatives living and working elsewhere in Fiji.
