Humphries v Newport Quays Stage 2A Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 699 (29 June 2009) For the reasons set out below, I have decided that it is not appropriate to make an order that the proceedings be tried together. Secondly, the applicants have made it clear that they are not applying for an order that the proceedings be consolidated. Counsel would need to be alert to the evidence rulings about cross-admissibility. Mr DeRuvo states that in each proceeding the applicant intends to call a number of applicants in other proceedings as witnesses in his or her trial.
