However, the second named applicant has made no such claim. 15 The first ground asserted a failure by the Tribunal to comply with s 424 of the Act by inviting the appellants to give oral and written evidence and then failing to consider the written evidence of the three witnesses provided subsequent to the actual Tribunal hearing. In relation to the two witnesses other than Mr Arounsavat, pursuant to s 426(3) , the Tribunal did consider the appellants' request to obtain evidence from the witnesses.
