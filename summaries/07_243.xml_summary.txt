The applicant submitted to the Tribunal a photocopy of a photograph of himself holding a Falun Gong badge. This evidence was not accepted by the Tribunal merely because the facsimile date showing on the paper contradicts to the applicant's claim that he received the copy two days before the hearing. 13 The applicant filed an affidavit in support stating:   (1) On 25 September 2006 I did not appear at the Federal Magistrates Court for the Hearing. 1 This is an application for leave to appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 27 November 2006.
