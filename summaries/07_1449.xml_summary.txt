The NBV submitted that its investigations of the professional complaints made against Ms Bahonko were entirely proper. 119 I accept the Minister's submissions that Ms Bahonko did not make any credible claim against the Minister, and refuse her application for an extension of time to bring proceedings against the Minister. Section 22(1) of the Nurses Act required the NBV to investigate any complaint about the professional conduct of a registered nurse. I should note that Ms Bahonko submitted that the decision of Weinberg J should not be followed. There is simply no evidence to support these allegations.
