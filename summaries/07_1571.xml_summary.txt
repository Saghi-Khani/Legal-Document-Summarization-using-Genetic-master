2 PGA and PGA Tour are both golfing associations structured as not-for-profit companies limited by guarantee. 4 At the first court hearing (on 9 October 2007), the plaintiffs sought, and I made, an order under s 411(1) of the Act that PGA convene a meeting of the PGA Members for the purpose of considering and, if thought fit, agreeing (with or without modification) to the scheme of arrangement proposed to be made between PGA and the PGA Members (the PGA Scheme). Of the total membership of 178 PGA Tour Members, 157 belong to the "Full Member" class.
