The essence of the scheme consisted of the arrangement whereby the 9 Wills Brands were disposed of by the Taxpayer to Rothmans and then by Rothmans to the Imperial Group, after there had been a rollover choice to enable the Taxpayer to avoid capital gains tax. On 16 July 1999, Wills Holdings, Rothmans Holdings and BAT Australia entered into a Merger Implementation Agreement . They were only capable of transfer to companies that, prior to the merger, were members of the Rothmans Holdings group, including Rothmans. Mr Dunkley prepared a memorandum for Mr Kingsley to send to Mr Hardman.
