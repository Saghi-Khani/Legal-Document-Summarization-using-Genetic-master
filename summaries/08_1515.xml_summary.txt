Mr Smith will consent but seeks permission to go on an overseas holiday with his family for 10 days from 29 September 2008. 4 For these reasons, Mr Vandeloo suspects that Mr Smith may have contravened several provisions of the Corporations Act , including s 181 and s 182. Mr Smith says that, if permitted to travel, he will return to Australia and continue to co-operate with ASIC's investigation. The deed also had the effect of amending the principal lending agreement between ANZ and Opes. Mr Smith was involved on the Opes side of those transactions.
