On 10 August 2005, Federal Magistrate Raphael made orders by consent extending time for compliance with the bankruptcy notice until three working days after the decision was made on a strike out application then pending in the District Court brought by the respondent in respect of the appellant's cross-claim. The bankruptcy notice was issued by Leonard Cohen & Co on 13 January 2005 in relation to the above judgment debt. The appellant submits that the undertaking does not cover an opposition to a creditor's petition on the ground that the bankruptcy notice should be set aside.
