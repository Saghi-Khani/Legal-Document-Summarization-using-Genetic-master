CONSIDERATION  The Share Scheme Under the proposed Share Scheme, all of Sino Gold's issued ordinary shares not already owned by members of the Eldorado Group will be acquired by Eldorado Pacific. As noted earlier, out-of-the-money options are those that have a strike price at or above A$7.17 (or C$6.49). Assif SA holds options in the same series. Accordingly, it is appropriate to describe the proposed in-the-money class as the intrinsic value methodology class, and the proposed out-of-the-money class as the Black-Scholes methodology class.
