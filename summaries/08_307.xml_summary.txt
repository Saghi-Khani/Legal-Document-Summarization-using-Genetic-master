In round terms, that figure would have been approximately three-hundred thousand dollars ($300,000). Order 23 r 2 provides that a party may make to another party an offer to compromise any claim in the proceeding on the terms set out in the notice of offer. The plaintiffs should be ordered to pay Holcomm Marine's costs up to and including that day on the party-party basis, subject to one caveat. 5 Holcomm Marine made two offers to the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs accepted neither offer. As I indicated in my earlier reasons, the cross-claim should be dismissed.
