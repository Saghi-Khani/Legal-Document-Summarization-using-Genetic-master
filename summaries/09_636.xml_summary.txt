At the first meeting of creditors of AGL, Mr Silvia as Chairman informed those present that he and Mr Green proposed to seek the extension of the convening period for up to four months. CONCLUSION  For the above reasons I made the orders referred to. Section 439A(6) empowers the Court to extend the convening period on an application made, relevantly, during the 20 business day period. The three administrations began on 6 May 2009 (see s 435C(1) of the Act). There are extensive cross-collateralised securities and obligations within the Group. The SPVs are not in administration.
