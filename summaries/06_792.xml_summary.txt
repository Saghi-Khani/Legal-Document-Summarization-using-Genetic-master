Mr Armitage's lengthy affidavit of 16 May 2006 deposes to matters of fact. 6 In Wu , I considered (at [6]-[25]) the extensive history of delay and non-compliance with the Court's orders by the first and second respondents. RELEVANT BACKGROUND  3 The orders of 3 February 2006 were made following the hearing, on various dates, of the applicant's motion for default judgment. Ms Krycer also gave evidence concerning Mr Armitage's notice of appeal and related matters. Further, I would order that Mr Armitage pay Ms Wu's costs of his motion.
