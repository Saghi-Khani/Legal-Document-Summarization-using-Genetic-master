However, in the present case, the Tribunal member does not appear to have given consideration to the fact that the application for review had been on foot since 1 May 1998. I propose to discuss [the applicant's] medical condition with Dr Samad following this consultation. In that part of the Tribunal's reasons under the heading 'Findings and Reasons for Decision', the Tribunal first of all dealt with the decision to go ahead without giving the applicant a further opportunity to appear.
