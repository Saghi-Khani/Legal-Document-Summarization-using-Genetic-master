1 Following upon the judgment as to liability ( Heritage Clothing Pty Ltd trading as Peter Jackson Australia v Mens Suit Warehouse Direct Pty Ltd trading as Walter Withers [2008] FCA 1775) the parties have now filed written submissions as to costs. 8 The damages claim was substantially modified at trial, but even so Peter Jackson failed to establish that the closure of the William Street store had any connection with any wrongful conduct of MSWD. This was the only representation on which Peter Jackson succeeded at trial. 10 In the circumstances therefore no question of one-third off reduction arises.
