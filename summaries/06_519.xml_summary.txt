1 When I was delivering my judgment ex tempore in this matter on 12 April 2006, it occurred to me for the reasons I then gave ( Natural Floor Covering Centre Pty Ltd v Monamy (No 1) [2006] FCA 518 at [34] - [35] ('the first judgment') that charge 2 was bad for duplicity: Johnson v Miller [1937] HCA 77 ; (1937) 59 CLR 467. I also directed the respondent to file and serve any submissions in response by 28 April 2006. The applicant applied to amend charge 2 in its submissions dated 18 April 2006. Here, the facts were substantively unchallenged.
