2 The one issue on which the parties are not agreed is whether there should be a condition imposed on the grant of leave to appeal which has the effect of requiring Comandate Marine to obtain the discharge of two orders made by courts in the United States of America and in England. Subsequently, Comandate Marine moved to refer the proceedings to arbitration and I heard that application on 13 and 14 July 2006 and gave judgment on 22 August 2006. I do not see any purpose in staying such an order.
