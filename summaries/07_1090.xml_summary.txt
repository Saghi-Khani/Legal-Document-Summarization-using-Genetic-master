Statutory requirements of invitation to attend Tribunal hearing  16 In relation to the issue whether the Tribunal failed in its duty to invite the appellant to a hearing, Nicholls FM found that the Mount Waverley address on the migration agent's fax cover sheet dated 8 November 2000 and attached to the original Application for Review was the most recent address provided for the appellant's adviser. Accordingly his Honour refused to exercise his discretion to grant the relief sought by the appellant and dismissed the application. The period of notice was too short by 3 days.
