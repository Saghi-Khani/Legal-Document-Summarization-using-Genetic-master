Austrade considered Isaac Jewellery to be a continuation of the business previously conducted by ABJ. The business exported substantial quantities of manufactured jewellery and received grants under the EMDG Act. DID THE TRIBUNAL ERR? The appeal is allowed. The issue for determination was whether the new business was similar to the old business as provided for in s 94(1)(b)(ii). Under s 94(1)(b)(i) a decision is required to be made in respect of the question whether the new owner is carrying on the old business or a part thereof.
