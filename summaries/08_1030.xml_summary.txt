15 In all the circumstances, I consider that the appropriate disposition is that Mr Waller and Wainter pay the plaintiff's costs of and incidental to their application to be heard on 8 May 2008 including costs of their submissions in relation to this costs order. On 26 May 2008 reasons were delivered in support of orders adjourning the plaintiff's application and dismissing the application by counsel for Mr Waller and Wainter for leave to be heard ( Freehills, in the matter of New Tel Limited (in liq) ACN 009 068 955 [2008] FCA 762). Substituted service was also sought.
