As to the question whether legal proceedings were in contemplation at that time between AMC and Hamilton, I am not satisfied on the material before me such was the case. 10 The focus of the contemplation referred to in subs (3)(a) is, as Lindgren J indicated in the Advanced Medical Institute case, upon the contemplation of the person who "prepared" or "obtained" the relevant representation. The first relates to whether, though business records, the documents contain representations which are rendered inadmissible under s 69 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) because of the exception prescribed in s 69(3).
