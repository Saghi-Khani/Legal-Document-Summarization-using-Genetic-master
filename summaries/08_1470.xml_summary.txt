10 The appellant's position is that these facts engage ss 793(1)(j) and (k) of the Workplace Relations Act which sets out two prohibited reasons for conduct proscribed by s 792 of the Act (which includes a proscription on an employer terminating an employee's employment). The section applies to all employees and independent contractors in any capacity. Courts are not persons or bodies that seek compliance with the law. The appellant's statements, considered together, alleged contraventions of industrial laws. The trial judge had also dismissed the principal proceedings (see above). The following examples demonstrate this process.
