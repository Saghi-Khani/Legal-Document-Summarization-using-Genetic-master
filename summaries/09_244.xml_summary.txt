Fifthly, the Federal Magistrate said that the petitioning creditor would be prejudiced if the judgment was to be set aside. By a letter dated 19 July 2007, Ms Khadpekar requested that the respondent, who is the trustee of Ms Khadpekar's bankrupt estate, appeal or assist in appealing the decision of the Cairns Magistrates Court. In other words, she believes these reports will support her contention that the trustee wrongly exercised his discretion in not seeking to appeal the orders made in the Magistrates Court. There is no application under s 178 for consideration in this case.
