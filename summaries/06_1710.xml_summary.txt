Introduction  1 On 28 June 2006 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) filed an application for the winding up, on the ground of insolvency, of Forestview Nominees Pty Ltd (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (Forestview). 27 Forestview executed guarantees and indemnities in favour of a number of Mezzanine finance companies associated with Mr Carey and Westpoint Corporation. He saw the Forrestfield Shopping Centre as analogous. That leave may be given subject to conditions (s 459P(4)). ASIC was to file and serve any affidavit in reply by 25 August 2006. This grant was made without the consent of ING.
