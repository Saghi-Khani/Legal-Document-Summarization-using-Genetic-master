The only evidence before the Court that Mr Strahley made the representation to Mr Tracy claimed by the applicants is the oral evidence of Mr Tracy that he recalled Mr Strahley making a statement referring to $1.5 million for the lemon crop at the meeting of 3 December 2004. 61 Mr Bailey's report was completed on 17 January 2005. Mr Bailey deposed that he recalled that Mr Breed telephoned Mr Strahley to seek instructions as to whether information could be provided to Mr Bailey (Bailey affidavit sworn 19 July 2006 at [10]-[11]). However that is not material.
