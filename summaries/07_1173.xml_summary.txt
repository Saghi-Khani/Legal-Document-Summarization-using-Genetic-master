The Tribunal failed to assess the chance of my persecution on my return to China because of my involvement with Falun Gong. REASONS  27 The appellant's notice of appeal largely repeats the grounds of appeal before the Federal Magistrate. However, because the appellant's claims in this respect were rejected the independent information was not relevant. The Tribunal failed to consider my claims. A delegate of the first respondent refused the application for a protection visa on 21 June 2005. The Tribunal then determined to affirm the decision under review on 6 September 2006.
