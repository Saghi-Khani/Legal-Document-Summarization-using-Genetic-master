Although differing as to the weight such evidence should be given, the parties also appeared to accept more generally that evidence of events taking place after the priority date, whether that be the applicant's use of the mark itself or use of other similar or otherwise relevant shapes by rival traders, may be relevant to whether the seahorse shape is capable of distinguishing Guylian's goods. In evidence were six of the boxes Guylian sells containing the sea shell chocolates. It is a system about trade marks, badges of trade origin. Application No. The shape is clearly a seahorse.
