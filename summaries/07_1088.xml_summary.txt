The appellant has not responded to them. 10 Having regard to those matters, and the terms of MSI 368 generally, I accept the submission that it does not prescribe matters in cl 17.2.1 which the Tribunal was obliged to take into account when considering how to exercise the discretion as to whether to cancel the visa, once the breach of Condition 8101 had been made out. An application to the Federal Magistrates Court to set aside the decision of the Tribunal for jurisdictional error was dismissed on 8 February 2007.
