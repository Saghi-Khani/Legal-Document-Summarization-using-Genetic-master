It may seem curious that a person employed directly by the Navy, Army or Air Force who had no dependants was not eligible for membership. It would be quite unsafe for a court to conclude that one fund, overall, provided "better benefits" than another fund or all other funds. Navy Health is a fund belonging to the members. The contentious question is whether the applicant was such an institution. However, it is clear that the words are not limited to charitable purposes.
