The present dates for trial commencing on 25 June 2007 were allocated with a view to ensuring that the matter would be able to proceed and be completed without any risk of any further adjournment. 5 Accordingly I propose to make a direction vacating the dates for trial. 4 The Court however is sympathetic to the circumstances confronting both Mr Black and the applicants by reason of Mr Black's cardiac event. 2 The respondents are represented by Mr Flanagan SC. The applicants are represented by Mr Anderson of counsel. The parties jointly sought an adjournment of the trial.
