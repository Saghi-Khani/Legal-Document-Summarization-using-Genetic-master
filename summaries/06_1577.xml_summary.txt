2 The applicant filed her application for an extension of time on 14 July 2006, almost three years after the decision of the Tribunal was made. The notice of appeal also contains grounds alleging that the Tribunal ignored some of the claims in the statement attached to her application which she now says were untrue. The applicant was present in Court when his Honour delivered reasons on 4 February 2004. 7 The application will therefore be dismissed with costs. Some, at least, of that information had been provided by her. She at no time wished to obtain a protection visa.
