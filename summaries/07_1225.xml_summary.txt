In that judgment Kenny J gave consideration to the circumstances in which costs, including indemnity costs, might be awarded against self represented litigants. I accept Ms Penhall-Jones' submission that any order for costs should be made on the basis that she pay party/party costs and not indemnity costs. 6 One specific issue raised by Ms Penhall-Jones was whether costs should be allowed to the respondent for senior counsel. I can see no reason why an order for costs in the present matter should be stayed. Penhall-Jones v NSW (No 2) [2007] FCA 1225 (16 August 2007)
