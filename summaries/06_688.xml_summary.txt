The Honourable Court also erred in law in determining that the Refugee Review Tribunal ("the Tribunal") was in a breach of procedural fairness. It did not accept that he was detained in August 2002 or January 2003. 10 The appellant provided documents at the hearing concerning his claim to membership of the All India Youth Wing of Akali Dal. That application came on for hearing on 19 January 2006 and on that date, his Honour, Smith FM, dismissed the application. No jurisdictional error was disclosed. They were not relied upon as part of the Tribunal's reasoning process.
