Request a stay on hearing the notice of appeal dated 18 February 2009 pending the outcome of the Supreme Court matter file number 3747/2008. On 9 December 2008 in the Federal Magistrates Court proceedings the first, second and third respondents applied for summary judgment in respect of para 3 of the first respondent's amended application. Both Ms George's application and notice of motion are supported by affidavits filed in these proceedings. Accordingly his Honour adjourned the hearing without making any orders. The matter came before Dowsett J on 6 March 2009.
