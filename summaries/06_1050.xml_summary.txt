5 On 10 August 2006, the solicitors acting for the first respondent in this proceeding forwarded a letter to AWB's solicitors which advised that, while the first respondent would abide an order of the Court, his position remained that he proposed to publish the documents on the Inquiry's website as they were not the subject of any claim for legal professional privilege. I do not think that this possible future circumstance supports AWB's contention that publication poses a real risk of interference with the processes of this Court or the administration of justice generally.
