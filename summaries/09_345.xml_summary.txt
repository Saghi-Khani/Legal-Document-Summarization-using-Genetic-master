In what appears to be the first such report, dated 11 January 2008, Ms Young said:  "Another important issue is that Mrs. Budd is waiting for a mobility allowance to be granted to help with the expenses incurred in her charitable work. I cannot travel outside the home ...   ... [I] cannot do face to face voluntary work ...   ... Ms Budd is handicapped. " (Emphasis added. ...   I cannot leave home due to Agoraphobia ..."  Ms Budd's earlier application, seeking to appeal to this Court from the decision of the AAT, was defective. It was also out of time.
