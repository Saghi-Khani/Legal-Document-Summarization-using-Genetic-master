INTRODUCTION   1 On 12 September 2007, the applicant was informed, by letter, that his employment with the respondent was terminated for misconduct. Dismissal for this reason is prohibited by s 448 of the WR Act. An allegation was also made that he was dismissed for engaging in protected industrial action. 39 It is appropriate to address, at this point, the differing accounts of the applicant and Mr Simmonds in relation to both this event and what may have occurred on the morning of 19 June 2007. His evidence was that Mr Reidy asked him to write down what had happened.
