Decision is not attended by sufficient doubt  4 No written submissions were provided to the Court in support of the application. Associate:Dated: 5 May 2006  The Applicant was self-represented. Accordingly, no substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal was to be refused, particularly in the light of the applicant's prior history of unsuccessful applications outlined above. The 'grounds' identified seek in substance, as I have stated above, impermissible merits review, and did not distil any conceivably viable error in the reasons for judgment of Smith FM. The present application constitutes plainly an abuse of process.
