However, in my view there were no relevant gaps in the material before the Tribunal, and for the reasons I have indicated, the evidence before the Tribunal supported the Tribunal's conclusions. It accepted that the contents of the report of Dr Collins, the survey material from Sweden referred to in the report of Tondel, the United Kingdom survey referred to by Professor Peach, and the bundle of documents produced by the respondent supported or pointed to a reasonable hypothesis connecting the service of the veteran and his exposure to benzene to his subsequent death from myelofibrosis.
