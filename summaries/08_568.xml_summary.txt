1 This proceeding is concerned with the construction of s 170(10AA) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) ( the 1936 Act ). Thus, the Taxpayer says, the power to amend at any time conferred by s 170(10AA), is triggered only if the subsequent event occurs after the original assessment is made or is deemed to be made, so necessitating the amendment of the original assessment. 31 Item 50 refers to s 104-40(5). Section 104-10(1) of the 1997 Act provides that CGT Event A1 happens if a taxpayer disposes of a CGT asset.
