I order that the respondent Minister pay the costs of the proceedings before the Federal Magistrates Court. The decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal of 28 June 1995 is also set aside and the matter is remitted to the Refugee Review Tribunal for determination according to law. 11 It is also my opinion that the first ground of appeal relating to the failure by the Tribunal to advert to the material put forward on behalf of the appellant is made out in this case. One section is headed 'Claims and Evidence', and that is then followed by a heading 'Reasons'.
