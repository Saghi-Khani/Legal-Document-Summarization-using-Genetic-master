The applicant submits that there were raised facts in the material before the Tribunal, and acknowledged in its reasons for decision, which supported the sub-hypothesis that the veteran's pre-service daily intake of animal fat was around or possibly slightly below the national average of 126 g per day. The applicant submits that the Tribunal erred by engaging in fact-finding when applying s 120(3). If the hypothesis fails to fit within the template, the claim fails; 4. the Tribunal must then decide whether it is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the death was not war-caused.
