18 The Tribunal simply did not accept the appellant's claims concerning the incidents following the elections in April 2004. The Federal Magistrate was in error by upholding the decision of the tribunal. The appellant also submitted the Tribunal failed to consider whether the facts as it found them to have occurred led to the conclusion that the appellants had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Refugees Convention reason. The tribunal did take them into account. The tribunal did find that while I did receive threats and harassment, it concludes that these did not amount to serious harm.
