I invited the applicant to put to me any matter that may support the application. 2 The application before Federal Magistrate Smith was an application filed on 29 August 2006 which sought an order that the respondents show cause why a remedy should not be granted under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in respect of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal dated 24 August 1998 and handed down on 25 August 1998. The application is dismissed under rule 44.12 on the ground that it does not raise an arguable case for the relief claimed.
