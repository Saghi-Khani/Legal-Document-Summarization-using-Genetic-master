Thus, the outcome of the appeal in Oreb , expressed in the orders of the Full Court, would, without more, determine the outcome of the remaining proceedings, including the matters of Dr Do and Dr Ho. 10 Accordingly, unless my order is set aside, and subject to the question of whether Drs Do and Ho did raise before the relevant Committees the possible application of Regulation 11 , these Notices of Motion turn upon the proper construction of my order of 3 December 2004. First, the person under review may rely upon exceptional circumstances under s 106KA(2). Costs reserved.
