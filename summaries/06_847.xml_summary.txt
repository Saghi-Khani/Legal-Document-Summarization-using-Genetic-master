As I recorded at [7] of my earlier reasons for judgment, Mr Teves apparently signed the valuations on behalf of ARMA which are presently in issue, by implication as author thereof. Macquarie Underwriting Pty Limited and SVB Syndicates Ltd respond in writing within a further seven days. I have accordingly made what seem to me to be appropriate orders in conformity with my reasons of 29 May 2006 and of today, including an order that the costs of the interlocutory proceedings to date be reserved. Permanent Custodians Limited v ARMA Pty Limited (No 2) [2006] FCA 847 (4 July 2006)
