FEDERAL MAGISTRATES COURT  The grounds for the appellant's appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court were: The Tribunal rejected the appellant's claimed involvement in the Falun Gong in China without considering all of the information the appellant provided. Nor is there any discernable jurisdictional error on the part of the Refugee Review Tribunal. WZANI v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2009] FCA 526 (20 May 2009) The Tribunal has no reason not to accept that the appellant would have faced the real prospect of harm in China if he returned. The appellant simply says the Tribunal made a wrong decision.
