5 The appellant made an application to the Federal Magistrates Court for judicial review of the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal. The material consists of a letter from the appellant, dated 26 August 2008, to the registrar of this Court, and a number of attachments. There is no apparent reason for a three-day period of incapacity within such a waiting period. The appellant pay the first respondent's costs of the appeal. There appears to be no basis for finding it to have been imposed invalidly. The judgment was given on 31 March 2008.
