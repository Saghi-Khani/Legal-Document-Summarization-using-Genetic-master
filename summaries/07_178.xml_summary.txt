It was dismissed by Edmonds J on 12 May 2006: SZERD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 560. The decision of Raphael FM, that the fresh application was an abuse of process, was based upon the application of the principles in Anshun [1980] HCA 41 ; 147 CLR 35. The focus remained on the RRT's reasons. That Rule applies only where leave to appeal is sought from an interlocutory judgment of the Federal Court. In my view it was therefore a final judgment. His application for special leave to appeal is still before the High Court.
