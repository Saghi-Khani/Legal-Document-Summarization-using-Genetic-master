3 The plaintiff has on issue three classes of shares, Ordinary Shares; Step Up Preference Shares; and Reset Preference Shares. 2 The proposed schemes of arrangement require the approval of this Court pursuant to s 411 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Corporations Act ) because it is a compromise or arrangement between a Part 5.1 body and its members and its classes of members. If the Court were not satisfied that the Explanatory Statement was appropriate to be sent to the members it would be unlikely to convene a meeting.
