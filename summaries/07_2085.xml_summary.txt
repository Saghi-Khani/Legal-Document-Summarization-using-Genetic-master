1 On 5 September 2006 The King & I Pty Ltd (the company) was wound up on the grounds of insolvency. Mr Posner now applies for the winding up to be terminated as the company is solvent and all creditors support the termination of the winding up. The general background and circumstances which led to the winding-up order should be explained: Krextile Holdings Pty Ltd v Widdows (supra). Such an application may be made by a liquidator of the company. The current trading position and general solvency of the company should be demonstrated. I accept that evidence.
