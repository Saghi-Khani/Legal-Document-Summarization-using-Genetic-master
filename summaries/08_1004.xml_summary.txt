30 The request for Ms Evans's assistance came from Mr Dekkan's new solicitor, Mr Lofitis. 47 After hearing evidence I was satisfied that Mr Dekkan was able to present his case before me and I declined to vacate the hearing. 15 Uther Webster & Evans acted for Mr Dekkan until June 2007 when the retainer was terminated. 14 An application for leave to appeal was filed in the Court of Appeal in February 2007. 17 The retainer was also extended to cover the proceedings involving Mrs Picciau and the claim for an apprehended violence order.
