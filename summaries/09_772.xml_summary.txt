THE ISSUES  City Pacific submits that on its proper construction, s 601FM(1) requires that in order to replace a responsible entity, two extraordinary resolutions must be voted on separately at one meeting, one resolution removing the serving responsible entity and the other, appointing a replacement. I do not understand the plaintiffs to seek a declaration of invalidity pursuant to s 1322(2). On 4 June 2009 ASIC wrote to Mr Bacon identifying "a number of concerns" in connection with the explanatory memorandum. Thus, in s 249D , the Act speaks of "any resolution to be proposed".
