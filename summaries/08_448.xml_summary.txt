2 On 13 March 2008 the first mortgagee, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), and the second mortgagees, AVS Property Pty Ltd (AVS) and Rental Fleets Australia Pty Ltd (Rental Fleets), were ordered to discharge their respective mortgages over the land so that the contract for its sale could be completed. 21 First, a significant part of the receivers' claim is to costs incurred in the realisation of the Mews land; that is to say, costs which, on any view, they are entitled to take out of the proceeds. That point needs some development. The agreement, then, can be ignored.
