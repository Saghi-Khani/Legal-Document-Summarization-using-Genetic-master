The Court declared that Cosic Holdings breached section 65AAC of the TPA by participating in a pyramid selling scheme known as Emerald Passport. Distributors must first become a Phase 1 Director, after which they may then qualify to become a Phase 2 Director, and then a Phase 3 Director. See also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc at [20], per French J. (collectively, the Products). The parties also consent to the making of injunctions. The Emerald Passport website promotes products which are only sold through the Internet as part of the Scheme.
