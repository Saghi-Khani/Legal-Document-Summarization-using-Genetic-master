The request for documents and the proceedings before the Tribunal  4 On 18 February 2005, the applicant made a request of the respondent under s 15 of the FIO Act for certain documents. He submits that he should have been given the opportunity by the Tribunal to challenge Mr Norman's evidence about the searches conducted by the respondent of its electronic databases. I found some of the submissions difficult to follow. 1 This is an application challenging a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal'). The applicant refers to s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).
