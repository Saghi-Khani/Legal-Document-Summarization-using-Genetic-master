The Appellant now appeals to this Court. Her claim was based upon an assertion that she was a Falun Gong practitioner who feared persecution if she returned to China. The handwritten Notice of Appeal sets forth the Grounds of Appeal as follows (without alteration): 1. the Tribunal did not carefully consider the information which was in favour of the applicant. 3 On 4 February 2008 the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking review of the Tribunal's decision: SZLHA v Minister for Immigration & Citizenship [2008] FMCA 143. The Tribunal's view flows from its findings about her credibility.
