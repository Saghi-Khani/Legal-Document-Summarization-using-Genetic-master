4 In the circumstances, I see no point in imposing any penalty on Mr Fry for his breach of s 298SC of the WR Act . However, Mr Anton was 'a strange beast' on the site, being a self-employed contractor. Section 170NC  7 In the substantive judgment Mr Fry was found to have breached s 170NC of the WR Act . He was also a CFMEU shop steward. He was engaged on the construction side of the project. 5 The CFMEU has vicarious liability for Mr Fry's breach of s 298SC of the WR Act .
