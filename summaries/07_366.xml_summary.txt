The letter of 22 August 2005 included details of CSR's contention that the Top Hat Batten Patent claim would fail because of lack of novelty. Hardie never filed evidence in support of the infringement claim, notwithstanding successive orders of the Court to do so. The respondents/cross-claimants, CSR Limited and CSR Building Products Limited (together CSR), seek costs on an indemnity basis. It has led no evidence as to the reasons for the discontinuance. Meanwhile, CSR became obliged to file its evidence relating to invalidity. The preparation of those affidavits caused a revision of the particulars of invalidity.
