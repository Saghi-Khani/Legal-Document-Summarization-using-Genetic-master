2 As the applicants wished to consider the reasons for judgment published on 13 June 2008, I set a timetable for the exchange of submissions as to the costs of the proceeding. This case did concern public interests, that is it concerned whether the Minister's decision was made in accordance with the EPBC Act so that the environmental interests which the Act recognised were properly considered. It opposes the claim of MRM for costs of the proceeding to be ordered against it. The standing of the applicants was a significant issue, until ultimately acknowledged.
