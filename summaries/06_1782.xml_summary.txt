Counsel for the applicant submitted that there is no such offence in Australia. The applicant claims that the advice did not identify the conduct allegedly constituting the extradition offence with sufficient precision. 2 Section 16(1) provides that where the Attorney-General has received an extradition request from an extradition country, he may, in his discretion, give notice to any magistrate that the extradition request has been received. 31 I respectfully accept the view expressed by Young J in von Arnim (see [18] above) that the Minister must carefully scrutinise the case for extradition before issuing a s 16 notice.
