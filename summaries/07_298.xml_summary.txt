The beneficiary wishes to fund the purchase (in whole or in part) out of his superannuation benefit. That payment would be a payment made "in favour of" the member. The Trustee may reasonably have assumed that the form came from the Complainant on the basis that it was provided to the Complainant by the Fund. The question raised by this appeal is whether this is the correct construction of reg 6.22. (15) The Tribunal affirmed the Trustee's decision not to reinstate the applicant's account. The respondent took his case to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.
