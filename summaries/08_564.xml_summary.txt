The Full Court held that paragraph (f) operated to render decisions, made under s 155 of the Trade Practices Act , to issue notices which required provision of information and the production of documents as decisions to which s 13 of the ADJR Act did not apply. In order to issue the warrant a Judge must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for doing so: see s 130(3)(c). It follows that he was entitled to make the request for reasons which was made under s 13(1) of that Act. The application was supported by three affidavits.
