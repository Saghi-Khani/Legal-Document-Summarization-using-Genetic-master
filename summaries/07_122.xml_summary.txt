It stated that judgment was entered against Mr Roskell in the Local Court on 22 June 2000 and that interest was claimed from the date of judgment to 15 December 2004. 45 Mr Roskell also contended that a certificate of judgment was not annexed to the bankruptcy notice. 5 The creditor appeals against his Honour's order dismissing the petition. 33 I do not see how the incorrect reference to s 203E of the Legal Profession Act converted the correct statement about pre-judgment interest into an error in the bankruptcy notice. This was sufficient to found the notice.
