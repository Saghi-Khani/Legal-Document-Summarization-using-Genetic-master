INTRODUCTION   These are three appeals against appealable objection decisions made by the respondent ('the Commissioner') on objections lodged by the applicant against amended assessments of income tax ('amended assessments') for the years ended 30 June 1996, 1997 and 1998 (together 'years of income'). The payments which ACBB made to New Asia facilitated or enabled New Asia to fund Beresford to in turn provide the loans to Viney through Ms Rule's trust account. There is little, if any, evidence as to what this payment was for. (2) The dividend is taken to equal the amount paid, subject to section 109Y.
