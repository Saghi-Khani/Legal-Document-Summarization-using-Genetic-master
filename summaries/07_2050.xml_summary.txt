The Federal Magistrate's reasons  15 It seems from the Federal Magistrate's reasons that it was argued before him that the Tribunal had failed to consider a claim that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution by Jihadists who would pursue those persons who had converted from Islam to Christianity. The Tribunal member said that there was no reason why the appellant should return to Kano or any of the other northern Islamic states in Nigeria. The second Tribunal hearing took place on 29 September 2006. He is not a refugee. The Tribunal clearly rejected that claim.
