3 In proceeding NSD 1870 of 2005, Lundbeck Australia is the applicant and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing of the Commonwealth of Australia ("the Secretary") and Alphapharm are respondents. 6 Dr Traugott is Alphapharm's internal general counsel and therefore not within the expression "External Counsel". Both motions relate to inspection of discovered documents. 1 There are two motions before the Court, both brought by Alphapharm Pty Ltd ("Alphapharm"). The Lundbecks cross claim for infringement of the Patent. Ms Peach describes him as "the first and only lawyer employed by Alphapharm".
