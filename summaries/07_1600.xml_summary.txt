Mr Brereton says that Mango entered into the contract as trustee for WRVM which in turn acted on behalf of two joint venturers, GDK and Young Turks Pty Ltd (Young Turks). The balance was "paid" by a loan from WRVM. Mr Brereton and Mr McLeod decided to set up a retirement village in Western Australia. 6 At or shortly before the time WRVM sold the Mews land to The Mews Village Nominees both WRVM and GDK began marketing the scheme to investors. The second mortgage was in favour of AVS Property Pty Ltd. Their appointment as liquidators facilitated the investigation.
