On 1 August 2008 the defendant's solicitors sent a letter to the plaintiff's solicitors headed "Without Prejudice Save as to Costs" in which the defendant: (a) contended that there was no basis for the Court to make the orders sought and set out reasons for that contention;  (b) made an offer that the proceeding be terminated on the basis that the plaintiff discontinue the proceeding and that each party bear its own costs to date. In these circumstances, I do not consider that it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to reject the defendant's offer.
